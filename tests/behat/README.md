# Behat Feature Organization
New behat tests should be written for drupal-spec-tool.
See the contents of the 'features/drupal-spec-tool' directory for example.

Otherwise, try writing a Cypress test for what you are doing before adding more behat tests.
The gherkin test syntax (Given, Then, And, etc) is the same.
