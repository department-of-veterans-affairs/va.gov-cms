Feature: Translation functionality testing.

@api @user @translation
  Scenario: Translation admins can access configuration and interface translation.
    Given I am logged in as a user with the "translation_manager" role
    And I am at "/admin/config/regional/translate"
    Then I should see "User interface translation"

    And I am at "/admin/config/regional/config-translation"
    Then I should see "Configuration translation"

  Scenario: Content admins can not access configuration and interface translation.
    Given I am logged in as a user with the "content_admin" role
    Then I should receive status code 403 when I request "/admin/config/regional/translate"
    And I should receive status code 403 when I request "/admin/config/regional/config-translation"

  Scenario: Content admin can create a node and then translate it.
    Given I am logged in as a user with the "content_admin" role
    And I create a "landing_page" node
    And I click the "Translate" link
    And I click the button with selector "ul.dropbutton a[hreflang=es]"
    And I fill in field with selector "#edit-field-intro-text-wrapper textarea" with value "This is not Spanish."
    And I fill in field with selector "#edit-revision-log-wrapper textarea" with value "This is a revision message."
    And I click the button with selector "form#node-landing-page-form input#edit-submit"
    Then I should see "This is not Spanish."

  Scenario: Text with counter disabled on translations.
    Given I am logged in as a user with the "content_admin" role
    And I create a "basic_landing_page" node
    And I click the edit tab
    Then the element with selector ".field--name-title .textfield_counter_counter" should contain "Characters remaining"
    Given I fill in ckeditor field "field-intro-text-limited-html-0-value" with 1010 characters
    And I fill in "Revision log message" with "It is a message"
    And I save the node
    Then the element with selector ".field--name-field-intro-text-limited-html .form-item--error-message" should contain "cannot be longer"
    And I click the "Translate" link
    And I click the button with selector "ul.dropbutton a[hreflang=es]"
    Given I fill in ckeditor field "field-intro-text-limited-html-0-value" with 1010 characters
    And I fill in "Revision log message" with "It is a message"
    And I save the node
    # The following is a proxy for 'node saved successfully'.
    Then an element with the selector ".field--name-field-intro-text-limited-html textarea" should not exist
