Feature: Content Release
  In order to reliably and predictably release content
  As anyone involved in the project
  I need the content release page to manage and reflect an orderly underlying release process

  @new_content_release
  Scenario: The user should be able to deploy a content release from the Simple form
    Given I am logged in as a user with the "content_admin" role
    And I reset the content release state from the command line

    # Require user confirmation.
    When I am at "/admin/content/deploy/simple"
    And I stub form submission for the current page
    And I click the "Release content" button
    And I wait for form submission
    Then I should see "1 error has been found"
    And I should see "You must confirm that you understand this implication."

    # Confirm and release.
    When I check the checkbox with selector "#edit-confirm"
    And I click the "Release content" button
    And I wait for form submission
    Then I should see "Content release requested successfully"
    And I should see "Build request skipped; form is under test."

  @new_content_release
  Scenario: The user should be able to deploy a content release from the Git form

    # Require that we select a content-build branch.
    When I am at "/admin/content/deploy/git"
    And I stub form submission for the current page
    And I select the "Select a different content-build branch/pull request" radio button
    And I click the "Release content" button
    And I wait for form submission
    Then I should see "Invalid selection."

    # Select content-build branch.

    Then I should see "BRANCH main"
