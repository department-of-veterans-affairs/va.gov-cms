/**
 * @file Calculate a metric for the time to restore service.
 *
 * For our purposes, and because it's too substantial of a pain to calculate this
 * any other way, we define "time to restore service" as the delta between the
 * first failing commit and the current commit _according to their timestamps_,
 * not their actual test results.
 *
 * This metric is calculated as follows:
 *
 * 1. If the current commit has failed, we do not report anything because we are in
 *    the middle of a failure.
 * 2. If the current commit has passed, we determine whether the previous commit
 *    failed, and if so:
 *    A. We set the current commit as the "first passing commit".
 *    B. We calculate the accrued time in failure for the previous commit, that is,
 *    the time between the first failing commit and that commit.
 *    C. The time to restore service is equal to that accrued time in failure plus
 *    the time between the previous (last failing) commit and the current (first 
 *    passing) commit.
 *
 * For example, if we have the following commits:
 *    A. 2021-01-01: Passed
 *    B. 2021-01-02: Passed
 *    C. 2021-01-03: Failed
 *    D. 2021-01-04: Passed
 *
 * Then the accrued time in failure for commit C is 0, because it is the first failing
 * commit. The time to restore for commit D is 86400, because it is the first
 * passing commit after commit C, and the time between commit C and commit D is 86400
 * seconds.
 *
 * For another example, if we have the following commits:
 *   A. 2021-01-01: Passed
 *   B. 2021-01-02: Failed
 *   C. 2021-01-03: Failed
 *   D. 2021-01-04: Failed
 *   E. 2021-01-05: Failed
 *   F. 2021-01-06: Passed
 *
 * Then the accrued time in failure for commit B is 0, because it is the first failing
 * commit. The accrued time in failure for commit C is 86400, because the time between
 * commit B and commit C is 86400 seconds. The accrued time in failure for commit D is
 * 172800 (D - C + C - B). The accrued time in failure for E is 259200 (E - D + D - C +
 * C - B). The time to restore for F is 345600 (F - E + E - D + D - C + C - B).
