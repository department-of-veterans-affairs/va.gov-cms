# The purpose of this file is to create a number of malformed and/or poorly
# written files in the various programming/style/markup/etc languages that
# we use on a regular basis.
#
# This is so that when we can quickly verify that problematic code will trigger
# an appropriate response when testing a new or modified GitHub Action or other 
# test.
#
# We don't want to be in the situation where we're making random modifications
# to PHP files, injecting intentionally awful code, and then hoping that we
# remembered to undo those changes at merge time :)
#
# Instead, we create NEW files, with names that hopefully jar our senses enough
# that they don't just slip past.
#
# Note that common sense should still be exercised here, e.g. do not introduce 
# security vulnerabilities.  If one gets past QA, it's a very real problem.
# 
# These files should all be removed by executing the companion script in this
# directory.

# Change to the root of the repository, since we'll use relative paths.
