# VA Distribution Groups Managed by CMS

## Distribution Groups
- VA CMS Admin (cms-admin@va.gov): for administrators of the CMS. currently being leveraged for alerts from upstream systems when things go down and some other notifications i believe.
- VA CMS Support (VACMSSupport@va.gov): formally the contact method before JSD was in place. this is only used for a handful of notifications now.
