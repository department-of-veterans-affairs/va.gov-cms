# Access

## "what do people need to do before getting access to things" policy:

Going forward the following will apply to anyone working on a VA.gov team
 (including anyone on the platform team):
1. To gain SOCKS access to our tooling (jenkins, grafana, sentry), SAC
 adjudication will need to be completed and returned as "favorable". this should take <=8 days from the time a person joins the team; and
2. To gain access to our AWS environments (console and/or programmatic), eQUIP
 adjudication will need to be initiated. this should take <=30 days from the time the person joins the team.
to check on the status of either milestone for non-gov't employees (so, any folks working on any contracts), please check with @Hayter. and of course let me know if you have any questions!
