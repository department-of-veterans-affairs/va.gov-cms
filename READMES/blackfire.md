# Blackfire Support

Blackfire is a performance tool used for gathering and reporting how resources are used by PHP applications.  It can be used to measure the performance of a specific bit of code or an entire request.  This allows us to measure the performance impact of a code or platform change and debug performance issues.

See also: Dedicated Blackfire page in [the ddev documentation]([https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/blackfire-profiling/](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/debugging-profiling/blackfire-profiling/)).

## Configuration
Blackfire is licensed per-seat; if you need a seat, reach out in the #cms-platform channel on DSVA Slack.  Without a license, you will not be able to use Blackfire.

Blackfire will be configured for ddev at build time based on the presence of the `BLACKFIRE_CLIENT_ID` environment variable.  If it is set and non-empty, the Blackfire PHP module and Blackfire Agent will be installed. Otherwise, it will not be available. 

For Blackfire to work correctly, the following four environment variables must be set. They can be retrieved from [your Blackfire account credentials page](https://blackfire.io/my/settings/credentials).
- **`BLACKFIRE_CLIENT_ID`**
- **`BLACKFIRE_CLIENT_TOKEN`**
- **`BLACKFIRE_SERVER_ID`**
- **`BLACKFIRE_SERVER_TOKEN`**

These environment variables can be populated in several different ways according to your personal preferences and development needs.
- Recommended: if you prefer to associate these credentials only with this project, you might set them in a `.env` file in the root of this directory.
- If you only use Blackfire in this project, you might set them in your shell init script, e.g. `.zshrc` or `.bashrc`.

There might be other approaches that make more sense in your specific circumstances.

## Toggling blackfire

* Turn blackfire on with `ddev blackfire on`
* Turn blackfire off with `ddev blackfire off`
* You may need to do a `blackfire poweroff && blackfire start` if the above doesn't work. 

## Testing
To test that Blackfire is configured correctly, you can execute the following command once ddev has completed the build process: `ddev exec blackfire curl https://va-gov-cms.ddev.site/`

You should see a response similar to the following:
```
ddev exec blackfire curl https://va-gov-cms.ddev.site/
