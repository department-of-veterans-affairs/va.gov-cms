## GitHub Workflows

We use GitHub Workflows to accomplish the following important tasks:

- perform [continuous integration (CI) tests](./.github/workflows/continuous_integration.yml) on each commit
- initiate certain scheduled tasks, such as [pruning older file backups](./.github/workflows/s3-backup-retention.yml) or [reporting metrics upstream](./.github/workflows/actions-metrics.yml)
- providing [contextual advice](./.github/workflows/contextual-advice.yml) in pull requests

Performing these tasks means that our workflows must have privileges provided by access credentials.  Therefore, we have to monitor our use of third-party actions, embedded scripts, and other resources, and follow best practices in developing and maintaining our workflows.

Please follow the following guidelines:

- Pin all GitHub Actions at a specific commit.  A tag is not sufficient, as it does not protect us against the third party losing control over their account.  A commit SHA should protect us against any anticipated injection.

- Review the source code of the action at the commit you are pinning.  This should be performed again whenever the action is updated, for whatever reason.

- Do not attempt to work around GitHub's protective measures.  If you're trying to accomplish something in a GitHub Action that requires write permissions on a pull request, use the `pull_request_target` event instead and consult the examples in this repository.

- If you are struggling to test your action because it uses `pull_request_target`, and therefore needs to be merged to `main` to take effect, use the [CMS Test repository](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms-test/) instead during development and testing.  This will incur less suffering for all involved.

- Be careful with user-provided input, especially in scripts.  For example, do not read PR titles, comment bodies, or even the names of changed files in such a way that they might be executed as commands.

- If you need to check that a given workflow or action still triggers as expected, consider running the scripts `scripts/create-bad-test-files.sh` and `scripts/delete-bad-test-files.sh` to respectively create and delete files that can be used to test lints and checks.
