# 508 Office Audit
The CMS team requested an accessibility audit from the 508 Office. With this we need to have a process for bringing the issues from the audit into our backlog.

## Resources
- We used [example audit files](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/VA.gov-team-forms/blob/main/Accessibility/508-audits.md) from the forms team to be able to have an idea of what we could receive.
- We used the [labels](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/labels) that currently exist in our repo.
- We currently have a way of automatically tagging things based on if they are in a checklist inside our repo.
- We are looking into a 3rd party tool, [Advanced Issue Labeler](https://github.com/redhat-plumbers-in-action/advanced-issue-labeler), that uses [Github Issue Parser](https://github.com/stefanbuck/github-issue-parser) as a way to improve this automation.

## Flow
The [finalized flow](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1720471253526/cc9496d0c2db0fdb4a631d62be166e71a5ecb613?sender=u974c6e508bd6b6d3906a8513) we built lives inside Mural. We built the flow to be used for all teams throughtout the VA when they receive an audit. We also have a CMS specific flow in the larger flow for how to assign the tickets to the correct teams. For the CMS team, we have an [Accessibility board](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/1246/views/1) to collect the tickets along with the issues already found.
