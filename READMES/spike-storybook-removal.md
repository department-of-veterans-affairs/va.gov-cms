## Understanding usage of Storybook
Looks like Storybook (Node JS) was only used for within docroot/design-system.
The compiled product is also imported by the Drupal admin theme `vagovclaro` in that theme's templates with relevant compiled js + stylesheets are imported in the theme's libraries.yml file.
There is some yarn commands also referenced in composer.json file that builds out the storybook component which can be removed

---

## Plan of Action to remove Storybook
Since the Storybook is based in Node, it should be removed just like a npm package, with all its artifacts deleted first. The following steps can
be done on every folder utilizing Storybook (e.g. design-system)
- Delete the stories created this way
- Delete the .storybook folder
- Delete Scripts Added on to package.json
- Delete all storybook related content from package.json
- Run `npm install` to remove it from design-system
- Remove the design-system folder
- Remove all references of the storybook component withing the `vagovclaro` templates in `/docroot/themes/custom/vagovclaro`

## Plan of Action to Manage content Impacted from Storybook removal
Referring to the Storybook Node JS site, this will need to be done first in order to preserve the content as static files, as per this link [here](https://storybook.js.org/docs/sharing/publish-storybook)

If Content is not necessary, I would recommend deletion.
