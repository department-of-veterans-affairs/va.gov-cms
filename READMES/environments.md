# Environments & the Content Build Process

To enable end to end quality analysis, from the VA.gov CMS through to the public facing website, new feature review, and stakeholder demonstrations, multiple joined CMS/WEB environments may be created by any user with access to Tugboat. (More info on [Tugboat](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/blob/main/READMES/tugboat.md).)

The following table lists all environments and CMS/WEB sites used in the development process for VA.gov:

| Environment | Drupal (CMS) | Frontend (FE / WEB / Static) | FE Data source | Management |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| **PROD**<br> Live Site | [prod.cms.va.gov](https://prod.cms.va.gov)<br/>va.gov-cms: main | [www.va.gov](https://www.va.gov)<br/>content-build: main<br/>vets-website: main | prod.cms.va.gov | [BRD: Jenkins](http://jenkins.vfs.va.gov/job/deploys/view/Prod/job/cms-vagov-prod/) |
| **STAGING** <br> Pre-release testing. | [staging.cms.va.gov](https://staging.cms.va.gov)<br/>va.gov-cms: main<br/><br/>Staging CMS uses Tugboat Preview [content-build-branch-build (CMS PROD Mirror)](https://tugboat.vfs.va.gov/6189a9af690c68dad4877ea5) as its data source. This Preview is refreshed daily at 7am UTC (2am EST, 1am EDT), using the latest Database and Asset file snapshot from AWS S3 at that time.<br/><br/> * Staging CMS database edits will be overwritten the next time code is merged.<br/>* Staging CMS is not the source of data for the Staging front-end, meaning: edits you make in the Staging CMS will not cause the Staging front-end to be re-built, and your changes will not appear in the Staging.va.gov front-end. | [staging.va.gov](http://staging.va.gov)<br/>content-build: main<br/>vets-website: main | Tugboat Preview [content-build-branch-build (CMS PROD Mirror)](https://tugboat.vfs.va.gov/6189a9af690c68dad4877ea5) refreshed daily at 7am UTC (2am EST, 1am EDT), using the latest Database and Asset file snapshot from AWS S3 at that time.  | [BRD: Jenkins](http://jenkins.vfs.va.gov/job/deploys/view/Staging/job/cms-vagov-staging/) |

### Review Instances
**NOTE**: [Review Instances](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/review-instances) are another system that provides test environments, for CI PRs in vets-website and vets-api repos. RIs are managed by the Platform team. (Feb 2023: Platform has an active project underway to replace Review Instances; Ray Messina, POC.) That's not a CMS concern, other than to note: Tugboat does also indirectly act as the Content Data Source for RIs.
| Environment | Drupal (CMS) | Frontend (FE / WEB / Static) | FE Data source | Management |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| CI / PR for vets-website & vets-api<br> Pull Requests & Automated Testing | None provided | {hash}.review.vetsgov-internal<br/><br/>* vets-website or vets-api: specified branch<br/>* content-build: main<br/>| Review instances can't pull data directly from Tugboat. To work around this, when content-build merges to main, a process captures the data + files from CI (effectively, Tugboat Preview [content-build-branch-build (CMS PROD Mirror)](https://tugboat.vfs.va.gov/6189a9af690c68dad4877ea5) 7am UTC or latest refreshed data/assets) and pushes them to S3 to a different location than the every 15mins data + asset backup. Review Instances then pull and use the new S3 snapshot archive file. Therefore: the freshness of the data on a Review Instance will line up with timing for the last time content-build had a merge to main.  | NA |

### Other
* [Access](./access.md): how to access these environments  

* **To preview CMS non-prod data**: Publish the content in Tugboat PR Preview's CMS, then trigger a content release in the CMS (via `/admin/content/deploy`). You will see the content built from that Tugboat's CMS data. This will not include any changes to vets-website that are not in main.
* **To preview vets-website changes along with CMS / content-build changes**: 
  * **Staging [Dark launch](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/public-websites#shadow--dark-launches-of-content)** (for new content only). Allows preview of combined changes. Uses Staging CMS data & Frontend built from content-build main and vets-website main, so vets-website code changes must be merged to main. If vets-website changes are referenced by any existing CMS content, they should be placed behind a feature flag that can then be enabled on Staging.
  * **In Tugboat**: you must merge to vets-website main with your changes behind a feature flag. Then, enable the feature flag within the Tugboat instance. (TODO: is this a real thing? Tugboat runs vets-api?)

## What is an Environment?

_Environments_ are copies of the production site that are running newer
code or have different content that needs to be tested before going live.

_Environments_ can also be used for demonstrations or training, without worrying
about disrupting production content.

Each _Environment_ has both a _CMS_ and a _WEB_ site. The _CMS_ is a content management
system built with Drupal, and the _WEB_ site is a static HTML site, built with Metalsmith.

The _WEB_ build process consumes the content from the _CMS_ in the same environment.


## Important Concepts

- Each _WEB_ site is made up of generated "static" files. This means that the _WEB_ site reflects the content from the CMS _at the time the WEB Build process was run_.
- _CMS_ Editors will not see changes in the _WEB_ site until a "WEB Build" is triggered and the process completes successfully.
- The _WEB_ site will not be accessible until at least one "WEB Build" has run successfully. This happens automatically for CI environments, but not yet for Demo environments. If you get an error such as "Forbidden" when visiting the _WEB_ site, try running the _Rebuild WEB_ process again.


## Manually build a demo env: Step-by-step Instructions

1. Visit [https://tugboat.vfs.va.gov/](https://tugboat.vfs.va.gov/) and click on the "GitHub" link to log in with GitHub.

   ![CMS-CI Homepage](images/tugboat-home.png)

2. Click the CMS link and the click the "CMS Demo Environments" to visit the Demos page.

   ![Demo environments page](images/tugboat-demos.png)

3. Scroll down to the "Base Previews" heading and select "Clone" from the "Actions" menu.

   ![Clone Preview](images/tugboat-clone-preview.png)

4. Your demo environment has been created. It will be titled "master". Scroll to the top of the page, click on the "Settings" link for your new environment, and give it a title starting with your initials and a hyphen. Then, click the "Save Configuration" button.

   ![Preview Settings](images/tugboat-preview-settings.png)

5. If you wish to copy [prod.cms.va.gov](http://prod.cms.va.gov) using the latest content, do not change any additional options.

6. Click the "Preview" button for your environment to visit it.

   ![Environment Preview](images/tugboat-preview.png)

**NOTE:** The WEB site for this environment will not work until you trigger a WEB Build process on the "Release Content" page.

### WEB Build Process

Within each environment, the static HTML for the _WEB_ site is occasionally
"rebuilt" so that the latest content from that environment's _CMS_ is used.

The _WEB_ build process is tested in the CI system to ensure compatiblity with the
CMS content schema.

The _WEB_ build process is triggered automatically by certain actions in the CMS
or manually via the [command line](#cli-build).

#### Build Triggers

The _WEB_ instance of an environment is rebuilt when any of the following actions take place in the _CMS_:

- Facility Alert or Individual Facility Operating Status is created or updated.
- The "Rebuild WEB" button is pressed.
- @TODO: Document all current build triggers.

_Note to Developers:_ Keep this list up to date to help content editors understand the process.

## Rebuilding Environments Manually

There is a special button and form for rebuilding VA.gov environments. Use this
to manually trigger either a WEB or CMS rebuild (or both), and optionally check
out different code.

#### Step-by-step Instructions

1. Find the environment you would like to build in the [CMS-CI](1) site, and go to the preview.
2. Hover over the "Content" admin menu, and then click "Release Content".

   ![Environment Rebuild](images/tugboat-rebuild.png)

3. If you wish to just trigger a WEB rebuild with the existing content, do not change any other options.

   ![Release Content Form](images/tugboat-release-content.png)

   **For advanced users and developers:**

   1. If you wish to change the branch of the WEB project, click "Select a different frontend branch/pull request". Start typing to search by the name of the branch or pull request you wish to use.

   ![Release Content Web Branch](images/tugboat-release-content-web-branch.png)

4. Press the "Release content" button. You will see the status of your build under the "Wait for the release to complete" heading. You may view the build logs by clicking the "View logs" link.

   ![Content Release Status](images/tugboat-content-release-status.png)

5. Once the REBUILD process is complete, you can click the "Go to front end" button under the "Access the frontend environment" heading.

   ![WEB Link](images/tugboat-web-link.png)

6. That's it! If the process completed, you should see a site that looks like VA.gov.



## Creating new Environments

Within the [CMS-CI](1) platform, in "CMS Demo Environments", users can create new environments by cloning the "master" Base Preview.

## Hosting Architecture

All environments are hosted on VA GovCloud in AWS GovCloud.

The primary environments, DEV, STAGING, and PROD, are hosted in the _BRD_ system.

Pull Request Environments and Ad Hoc environments are hosted in the _CMS-CI_ system.

SOCKS proxy or PIV+GFE hardware is required for accessing VA internal network.

### BRD: Jenkins

> Build, Release, Deploy

[jenkins.vfs.va.gov](http://jenkins.vfs.va.gov/)

- Source Code: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/devops/tree/master/ansible/build/roles/cms
- Runs Continuous Integration for about a dozen different applications with different requirements, including `vets-website`, `vets-api`, `cms`, and soon `cms-ci`.
- BRD Process is standardized across apps using Ansible playbooks and roles. See the [DevOps Repo Documentation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/devops/blob/master/README.md) for more information.

  - The "Build" process creates the entire server image and permantently tags and archives it as an AMI.
  - The "Deploy" process delivers those images to the 3 "environments", _DEV, STAGING, and PROD_ and runs whatever
    hooks are needed.
  - The "Release" process continuously delivers code to each BRD Environment

    - Primary branch commits are automatically deployed to DEV and STAGING Environments.
    - Git Tags and GitHub Releases are created automatically if those commits pass testing.
    - "Environments" in the context of **BRD** are really different networks.
    - The "servers" that actually run the apps are activated AMI images, placed into the desired "environment".

### CMS-CI: Tugboat

> CI Platform

[tugboat.vfs.va.gov/](https://tugboat.vfs.va.gov/)

- _CMS-CI_ refers to the VA's implementation of Tugboat.
- Provides an environment per Pull Request, and allows creation of ad-hoc environments with any name, on any desired branch or Pull Request.
- Provides a Web UI for getting information and managing these environments
- Installed with open source Ansible roles, plus a custom playbook.
- Deployment of new releases of CMS-CI and Tugboat is handled by BRD in way very similar to CMS.
- Provides a complete SDLC pipeline for Drupal code:
  - Creates new environments when a PR is open.
  - Automatically tests the environment and passes status to GitHub to allow or block merging.
  - Destroys and rebuilds PR Environments and runs the full test suite again on every git push.
  - If the PR is merged or closed, environment is destroyed.
  - Notifies GitHub of deployment success or failure, with lnks to the environments.
- Includes the FE/WEB Build process in the Drupal CI pipeline.
  - Front-end WEB project can be built inside PR environments by using the "Release Content" page.
  - End-to-end testing of CMS+WEB with Behat and Cypress:
    1. Make CMS updates: Change content, publish state, etc.
    1. Run WEB build command to rebuild static assets.
    1. Confirm CMS change is visible in WEB static assets.
- Runs on a single EC2 instance.

#### SSH access to CI environments

To access a CI environment via ssh, go to that environment's page on Tugboat and click the "Terminal" link on the line for the "php" service.
