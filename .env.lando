# Lando Environment Variables
#
# This file is used by the file scripts/composer/EnvironmentHandler.php for setting environment variables when running the
# site using the Lando local development environment. It is loaded into the application in that file based on the existence
# of the LANDO server variable.
#
# If you wish to override these, you can create a .env file and that will be loaded instead.
#
# In CMS-CI, a .env file is written dynamically.


# Used by WEB build process.

# Tells composer yaml-tests command not to format process in blocks, but print directly.

# Used by behat tests.
# DO NOT use environment variable insertion here. Other systems may load this in a different order.
# @TODO: I could just have been tired: This used to use single quotes: that would prevent $VAR substitution from working at all.
# Looks like lando includes the " as the string!
