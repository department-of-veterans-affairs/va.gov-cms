/**
 * @file
 * This is the VA.gov-CMS Settings Simulatorâ„¢.
 *
 * Its purpose is to preview how settings files are read and processed for each
 * environment and validate the resulting configuration against an existing
 * baseline.
 * 
 * Run it with `php settings_simulator.php [ENV]`, where:
 * - ENV is an environment name normally provided by the CMS_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE 
 *   environment variable (e.g. "local", "tugboat", "prod").
 * 
 * WARNING: Note that this script may have unintended consequences when run
 * locally!
 * 
 * It will create files in a variety of locations to see which are and are not
 * included, which are and are not git-ignored, etc.  It will normally delete
 * them, but it's possible that it will fail to do so.  If these files are not
 * git-ignored, they will need to be manually deleted.
