# If testing changes to this file on the tugboatqa/php:7.1-apache image (current),
# use `apache2ctl -S` to check for syntax issues then `killall apache2` to get changes to take.
# Or "Stop" then "Start" the preview as that will restart apache2 too. Worth noting that
# `service apache2 reload|restart` doesn't work on this image as `runit` is used.
# Also `sv restart apache` acts like it works but it doesn't and doesn't bubble up any errors.
