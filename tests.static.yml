# This file is for test that should run as soon as the codebase is ready, before any services are started.
#
# The runner of this script (currently the jenkins slave container) must have PHP CLI and Composer installed.
#
#
#

# @TODO: these are in place as suggested tests to add in the future.
#
# @TODO: Decide: Do we install "yaml-tests" globally so we can test "composer install"?
#        Or. we cam run `composer install` again on the existing codebase, which would catch any errors too?
#        I think maybe the solution to this is the deployment system, which will mostly be external tools.
