# Getting Started



## For Designers
See this Figma: https://www.figma.com/file/ScABI31f3MRFEvQ8WitVPa/CMS-Design-System?node-id=806%3A15618

`#cms-design` in Slack

## For Devs
In the va.gov-cms repo:

```
ddev storybook
```

This will run a webpack dev server with hot reloading for local development, reachable at https://va-gov-storybook.ddev.site/


This Storybook has support for Twig and SCSS, including compatibility with Drupal-specific Twig filters and functions, like the `attributes` object or `|clean_id`.
Note that not every function or filter will behave 100% the same as in Drupal (e.g. `|t` will not translate anything inside Storybook), but it won't break your component.
