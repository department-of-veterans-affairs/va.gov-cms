      Will this step have a single question, a series of questions, or a repeated set of questions?
    </p>
    <p>
      Single questions can be added one at a time if you have several questions which make sense
      together as a step.  An example of this might be a name or a location and a date.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the submitter may have multiple responses, it make sense to add a repeating set of questions.
      These are useful for sets of answers like: employment history, medical treatments, or several locations.
