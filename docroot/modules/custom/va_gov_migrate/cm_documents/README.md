# Export directory for Content Model Documentation document exports

This directory is the temporary storage for CM Documents exported locally and
then imported to Prod.  Once they have been imported on prod, they are safe to
be deleted from here.

We should be "safe" removing anything that is more than 2 weeks old (to cover thngs like Holiday code freezes).
