ISRM operations support VA?s alignment with the FISMA of 2014 by implementing multiple elements of the policy to include Periodic Assessment of Risk, Security Plans, Periodic Testing and Evaluation, and Remedial Action Process. ISRM activities involve identifying, assessing, and monitoring risk to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of VA?s organizational assets.","?	Authority to Operate (ATO) System Processing and Risk Reviews - Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014 requires federal agencies to develop, document, and implement an agency-wide program to provide information security for the information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency. To satisfy this requirement, VA performs periodic risk assessments to determine the risk and magnitude of harm resulting from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, or modification of information that supports operations of the agency. In support of this requirement, ISRM?s Authority to Operate (ATO) System Processing and Risk Reviews program oversees the entire National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 800-37 Risk Management Framework (RMF) process to include, Authorization and Assessment (A&A) package review, briefings, and submissions. VA information system risk reviews are conducted in eMASS to address the periodic risk assessment requirement of FISMA. The A&A package is reviewed by the authorizing official (AO) and a formal declaration of an information system accreditation is either granted as an authorization to operate with conditions or outright denied.  In accordance with FISMA, the ATO process and risk reviews help identify risk at the both the system and mission levels. These reviews contribute to a holistic view of enterprise risk to confirm information systems and infrastructures are adequately protected.
?	Business Requirements Division (BRD) - BRD provides targeted cybersecurity expertise and support at the enterprise-level for programs, projects, and business lines across the VA. One area of support is providing guidance for systems and major applications through Steps 1-5 of the Risk Management Framework (RMF). BRD also performs security reviews of information technology acquisitions at the enterprise-level. Another area of support is oversight of the Memorandum of Understanding/Interconnection Security Agreement (MOU/ISA) process for the documentation of external connections.
?	Cybersecurity Risk Management (CRM) - CRM defines targeted cybersecurity knowledge to be provided at an enterprise-level for programs, projects, and business lines across VA. Additionally, CRM confirms that stakeholders are aware of identified risks and that those risks are measured in an effective and consistent manner, with the goal of sustaining a repeatable process for systems both internal and external to the network.
?	Governance Risk and Compliance/Enterprise Mission Assurance Support System (GRC/eMASS)- FISMA requires agencies to implement a process for documenting and implementing remedial actions to address deficiencies, information security policy, procedures, and guidelines of the agency. ISRM can track and present compliance with VA?s authorization requirements, further providing a holistic view of enterprise risk and inform risk-based decisions to keep information systems and infrastructure sufficiently protected. To address this requirement, as well as the Periodic Assessment of Risk element, VA has implemented tools that provide GRC known as the eMASS. The eMASS tool is a web-based Government off-the-shelf solution that automates a broad range of services for comprehensive, fully integrated cybersecurity management, including controls scorecard measurement, dashboard reporting, and the generation of the RMF process. eMASS provides an integrated suite of authorization capabilities and prevents cyber-attacks by establishing strict process control mechanisms for obtaining authorization to operate decisions. Additionally, it provides vulnerability scanning to assess ongoing compliance, measures operational risk, and provides guidance on risk-based determinations for VA?s information systems? authority to operate.
?	High Value Assets Oversight (HVA) - VA established the HVA Program Management Office under ISRM in accordance with the OMB Memorandum 19-03 requirements.

Community Care Claims Modernization -  The Office of Community Care is looking to modernize legacy claims processing systems to support the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA), Children of Women Vietnam Veterans (CWVV), Spina Bifida (SB) and CHAMPVA Caregivers claims. These programs provide health benefits where the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) shares the cost of certain health care services and supplies with eligible beneficiaries.

Caregiver Program (CARMA) - The VA?s Caregiver Support Program offers enhanced clinical and financial support for caregivers of eligible Veterans who are seriously injured. The MISSION Act of 2018 expanded eligibility of the program to Veterans of all eras, which will ultimately result in a 10-20-fold increase in the number of participants. This legislated expansion has required a substantial overhaul of all related IT capabilities to effectively manage and monitor the program.  The SecVA?s certification of IT systems signaled overall readiness for the beginning of expansion.

Community Care Referral and Authorization (CCR&A) System - The CCRA solution is an integral component of the VA Community Care Information Technology architecture which allows Veterans to receive care from non-VA community Providers. HealthShare Referral Manager (HSRM) is the Office of Community Care?s system used to manage all referral and authorizations for Community Care and it includes a portal to external providers to manage referrals, authorizations, and Veteran?s relevant medical documentation in a single location. This is a Software As-A-Service (SaaS) solution hosted in Amazon Web Services FEDRAMP High Government cloud.

VALOR/DMLSS/LogiCole/MEDCOI Implementation - Defense Medical Logistics Standard Solution (DMLSS) is a Government Off-the-Shelf (GOTS), Cloud-based Supply Chain Management (SCM) offering integrated and comprehensive supply chain, pharmaceutical, equipment and facilities management capabilities. LogiCole is the technical refresh, transitioning DMLSS and associated applications to a single, web-based application.

Electronic Health Record Modernization (EHRM) - The EHRM effort has three major components, (1) modernize VA?s legacy systems and associated infrastructure required to support a new industry-leading EHR solution, (2) provide Veterans and clinicians with a complete picture of patients? medical history, driving connections between military service and health outcomes through data analytics, and (3) implement a new EHR solution that is interoperable with DoD and community care providers, enabling the seamless sharing of records. This is a multiyear deployment to the VHA enterprise.

State Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP)  - MISSION Act Section 134 requires VA participation in a national network of State-based Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs. VA?s current PDMP program is behind industry practices; making it difficult to comply with laws, executive orders, or initiatives. VA?s current PDMP workflows are highly manual without a single connection to state PDMPs. State PDMP improves patient safety and public health by providing access to State Managed Prescription Databases. This access and data sharing will provide information to the health care providers which will increase their capabilities to manage all controlled substance prescriptions written by VA physicians.

Mental Health and Suicide Prevention IT Program - The Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention (OMHSP) is working to Improve mental health care by addressing current deficiencies in CPRS, target improvements to applications of key importance to mental health providers, advance technological support for interagency collaborations and secure data sharing in order to improve mental health care delivery and enhance Veterans? experience of care.

Telephony/Call Center Modernization - The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is modernizing Clinical Contact Centers (CCC) to serve as a ?virtual front door? to VA health care, providing Veterans additional choices for meeting clinical, pharmacy, scheduling, and administrative needs. Clinical Contact Centers provide Veterans and their caregivers immediate, 24/7, on-demand access to clinical and administrative services to address urgent and episodic health care needs over the phone, video, chat, and email.
