The alert will appear at the top of every page on your site.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Once a banner alert is created, it can be shared across multiple VAMCs, which may be helpful to VISN level editors. You can also add situation updates to a banner alert to keep people up to date as things evolve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In situations where the banner alert is shared across multiple VAMCs, but you want to create your own situation updates, you will need to create your own banner alert here, by disassociating the existing banner alert, and creating a new one tied to your VAMC.</p> "
