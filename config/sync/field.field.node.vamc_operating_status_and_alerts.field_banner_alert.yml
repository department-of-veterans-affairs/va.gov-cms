description: "<p>Banner alerts can be shared across multiple VAMCs, and created and managed at the VISN level, particularly for inclement weather such as hurricanes or winter storms that affect multiple VAMCs.  You can add a banner alert \"on the fly\" using this form, but in many cases a banner alert will already have been created and associated to your VAMC's operating status page.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Situation updates are added from within the Alert banner's edit interface. You can also add situation updates \"on the fly\" by editing the banner alert here, if you have permissions to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In situations where the banner alert is shared across multiple VAMCs, but you want to create your own situation updates, you will need to create your own banner alert here, by disassociating the existing banner alert, and creating a new one tied to your VAMC.</p> "
