  # Tugboat tests are not automatically set pending, even though they are
  # required in branch protection rules (see #10553).
  #
  # Therefore, a PR can inappropriately appear to be ready to merge if,
  # for instance, a composer.lock merge conflict prevents the Tugboat
  # preview from successfully building.
  #
  # This action sets these tests pending from an immediate GitHub Action
  # so that we can trust our automated code review processes more.
