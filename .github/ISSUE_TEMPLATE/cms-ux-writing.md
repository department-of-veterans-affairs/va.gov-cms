## User story
A story specifically written towards the user's need for text.

E.g. *As a user who may be making changes to content, I'd like a message that warns me before a deployment happens so I can avoid losing unsaved changes.*

## Context
*Get answers to the following and document here, or use [this handy MURAL template](https://app.mural.co/t/vagov6717/m/vagov6717/1585780955246/6b5e798420e2992bbd56d825de8c42fbf343dfa0), especially when working with screenshots.*

**1. Provide a link to the original issue**

**2. When/where users will see the changes?**

- E.g. *At the bottom of the page on the edit tab*

**3. What users might need to know about the new functionality?**

- E.g. *The deployment is a normal thing that happens every day at 3:30.*

**4. What do users need to do?**

- E.g. *Save their work beforehand, or take a break during the deployment window.*
