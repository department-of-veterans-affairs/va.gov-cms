## Proposed change

**What change to the Sections hierarchy do you want?** 

[For example: Move a branch of RS to VBA section hierarchy, so VBA, VHA, and NCA business line stakeholders can create and publish non-Veteran-facing RS articles.]


**What types of content are associated with this Section?**

[For example: Various Resources and Support content types.]

**Include a screenshot or diagram of this proposed change**

Example: 

Current R&S section hierarchy:  

```
None. All content is currently assigned to "Public Websites". 
```

New R&S section hierarchy

```
VBA
- Resources and support
VHA
- Resources and support
NCA
- Resources and support
DEPO 
- Public Websites
  - Resources and support
```



## Impact on existing users 

**Will anyone _lose_ access to editing content?**

[Example: No one will lose access.]

**Will any users _gain_ access?**

[Example: Existing CMS users at VBA, NCA and VHA will be able to create (and then edit) content in a Resources and support section in their respective sections.]

## Acceptance Criteria

Examples: 
- [ ] New "Resources and support" sections are added under each of the three main Administrations (NCA, VHA, VBA)
- [ ] All existing Resources and support content is moved to ...
