_Use this form to request change to the Sections hierarchy. You can expect a response within a week._

## Proposed change

**What change to the Sections hierarchy do you want?** 

_For example: Move a branch of RS to VBA section hierarchy, so VBA, VHA, and NCA business line stakeholders can create and publish non-Veteran-facing RS articles._


**What types of content are associated with this Section?**

_For example: Various Resources and Support content types._

**Include a screenshot or diagram of this proposed change**

_Example:_

Current R&S section hierarchy:  

```
None. All content is currently assigned to "Public Websites". 
```

New R&S section hierarchy

```
VBA
- VBA Resources and support
VHA
- VHA Resources and support
NCA
- NCA Resources and support
OCTO 
- Public Websites
  - Resources and support
```



## Impact on existing users 

**Will anyone _lose_ access to editing content?**

[Example: No one will lose access.]

**Will any users _gain_ access?**

[Example: Existing CMS users at VBA, NCA and VHA will be able to create (and then edit) content in a Resources and support section in their respective sections.]


# For CMS team to complete
