## Acceptance criteria

### Vet Center -> Talk to Michelle

### Mobile Vet Center closure -> Just unpublish (redirects unnecessary)

### Outstation -> Let's give it a soft landing



#### CMS help desk steps
**Note: If the help desk is waiting on information from the facility staff or editor, add the "Awaiting editor" flag to the facility with a log message that includes a link to this ticket. Remove the flag when the ticket is ready to be worked by the Facilities team. Be sure to preserve the current moderation state of the node when adding or removing the flag.**
- [ ] 1. Become aware that the facility is no longer on the Facility API (typically, via a Flag, but this may come in as a helpdesk ticket).
- [ ] 2. ~~CMS team submits [Redirect request](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Redirect+request&template=redirect-request-facility-url.md&title=Redirect+Request+for%3A+%3Cinsert+facility+name%3E), cc'ing Facilities team, and referencing this issue.~~ redirects are not necessary for Outstations.

#### Drupal Admin steps (CMS Engineer or Help desk)
_Help desk will complete these steps or escalate to request help from CMS engineering._
- [ ] 4. Drupal Admin bulk unpublishes the nodes.
