# Vet Center Outstation becomes a Vet Center
## Background
  Outstations have entries in VAST. When an Outstation becomes a full Vet Center,
  it gets a **new entry in VAST** with a new facility API id. When this happens, it will have a node created
  for it as part of the migration.
## Intake
- [ ] What triggered this runbook? (Flag in CMS, Help desk ticket, Product team, VHA Digital Media)
Trigger: <insert_trigger>

- [ ] Link to associated help desk ticket (if applicable)
Help desk ticket: <insert_help_desk_link>

- [ ] Name of submitter (if applicable)
Submitter: <insert_name>

- [ ] If the submitter is an editor, send them links to any relevant KB articles for this process.
KB articles: <insert_kb_article_links>

- [ ] Link to facility in production:
Facility CMS link: <insert_facility_link>
Facility API ID: <insert_facility_API_ID>

## Acceptance criteria
### CMS help desk steps
**Note: If the help desk is waiting on information from the facility staff or editor, add the "Awaiting editor" flag to the facility with a log message that includes a link to this ticket. Remove the flag when the ticket is ready to be worked by the Facilities team. Be sure to preserve the current moderation state of the node when adding or removing the flag.**

#### Edit new Vet Center
- [ ] 1. Become aware that the new Vet Center is now in the Facility API and in the CMS (typically, via a Flag, but this may come in as a help desk ticket).
- [ ] 2. Check with RCS(?) what district it belongs to, or it may be pulled from the former Outstation.
- [ ] 3. Update the Section (default is "Vet Center", but it should be under a district).
- [ ] 4.  Communicate with editor (cc VHA Digital Media) to give them go-ahead to complete the content. An Outstation does not have any services, but a Vet Center does, so these must be added.
#### Publish new Vet Center
- [ ] 5. When editor has prepared content and let help desk know, publish the new Vet Center.
- [ ] 6. Remove the `New facility` flag from the node.
- [ ] 7. Communicate with editor (do they need to be onboarded)

#### Close old Outstation and Create Vet Center URL
- [ ] 8. Create a [URL change request](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/new?assignees=&template=runbook-facility-url-change.md&title=URL+Change+for%3A+%3Cinsert+facility+name%3E), changing the entry from the old facility URL to the new facility URL. (**Note: The URL change request ticket blocks the completion of this ticket.**)

<insert_url_change_request_link>

### CMS engineer steps
- [ ] 9. Execute the steps of the URL change request ticket from step 8.

(Redirects deploy weekly on Wed. at 10am ET, or by requesting OOB deploy (of the revproxy job to prod) in #vfs-platform-support. Coordinate the items below and canonical URL change after URL change ticket is merged, deployed, and verified in prod.)

### Drupal Admin steps
_Help desk will complete these steps or escalate to request help from CMS engineering._
- [ ] 10. When the redirect has been made live, set the status of the Outstation node to 'closed'.
- [ ] 11. Archive the Outstation with a comment in the revision log that points to the new Vet Center.

### Helpdesk steps
- [ ] 12. Help desk notifies editor and any other stakeholders.
