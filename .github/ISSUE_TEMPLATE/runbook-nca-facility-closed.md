## Acceptance criteria

### NCA facility closure

### Drupal Admin steps
None:  Since NCA does not have a FE presence, the facilities get auto-archived by the CMS when they are removed from the Facilty API.  There are no flags created, and a revision log is added to the facility that indicates why it was archived.  When the NCA Facility product launches, the autoarchiving and this runbook will need to be updated.
