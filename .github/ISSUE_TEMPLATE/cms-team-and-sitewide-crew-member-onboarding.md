# Welcome to the VA.gov Modernization Team! 👋
We're thrilled to have you join us on this journey! 🎆🎉🙌

Our [vision](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14mK-4OMeEnR_-fgj62U4lUHBHg6htj4i4ucTA5DJFzg/edit#slide=id.g11ae1dc437e_0_1) is to craft a seamless editorial experience that empowers editors to create Veteran-centered content. In April of 2022, we also assumed responsibility for a portfolio of front-end products and sites.

The onboarding materials below are organized by chronological time to complete (day one, week one, week two, month one); and main category (why, how, who, what). There's a lot to digest but don't worry, your Delivery Manager will guide you, you'll have an onboarding buddy to provide support, and we'll also introduce you to your workstream's lead to help with specific things related to your discipline (UX, DevOps, Drupal Engineering, etc). In addition, you'll have the support of the entire team, who have all gone through this process before and are eager to answer any questions that arise. Come back to this ticket any time to refresh your knowledge on a specific topic covered below.

Have fun and we look forward to getting to know you! 😊

<details><summary>Day one</summary>

## Day one
### How?
- [ ] Read through our [team norms](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cs5FePhtR0LIJi63b9ZtqT7T6dphgB584UpfEbejSOc/edit#), which will also give an overview of how we apply the [USDS playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov/) and VA.gov platform [code of conduct](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/policies-work-norms/code-of-conduct.md).
### Who?
- [ ] Who is on the team? Read your [team members' user manuals](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/195otsT1IUxi_k8oEU21TUkvEG-6p5YQj?ths) and copy [the template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rvtoo8CQvE7dptcqmMVqmJ_hbKSNWJ983NXkDj_gVg0/edit?usp=share_link) to add your own
   - [ ] Share your user manual with your team in Slack, once you've created it!
### What?
- [ ] [Onboarding questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17fWcL-5p4T3H7dT2bbw02u_CHEZ0tDlszcoMVLfRqP4/edit?usp=share_link) - copy this template and fill out. Your delivery manager will review with you to fill in gaps.
- [ ] Contract - Discuss which contract you are on with your Delivery Manager or Program Manager. Your contract will determine your paperwork process.
- [ ] Read the [VA.gov platform mission and goals](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/cms/onboarding/library/VA.gov%20Platform%20Overview%202021.pdf).
- [ ] Open a VA.gov [Platform onboarding ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=&labels=governance-team%2C+analytics-insights&template=orientation-epic.md&title=Platform+Orientation+Template+%5BYour+name+here%5D). 
    * The VA.gov Platform team manages VA.gov tooling and network access. In order to receive access to the SOCKS network proxy (described later), you must complete this Github issue, and attend a Platform orientation. 
    * That will result in adding you to the [VFS Platform roster](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11dpCJjhs007uC6CWJI6djy3OAvjB8rHB65m0Yj8HXIw/edit?folder=0ALlyxurHpUilUk9PVA#gid=2042046665). 
    * If a Platform orientation isn't available for several weeks, sign up for the next available slot, then mention your Delivery Manager and/or Program Manager on your Platform ticket to expedite SOCKS access.

<details><summary>Week one</summary>

## Week one
The goals of this week are: 
1) get background paperwork completed as quickly as possible and 
2) start gaining context for what we're doing and why. 

### Paperwork: 
- [ ] Wait to receive an email directing you to the paperwork you should fill out for secure access to relevant VA systems. Federal contractors are required to complete many of the same forms as federal employees. If you're not sure which you contract you are on, ask your Delivery Manager.  
   - **VFS-CMS** or **Sitewide Crew** contract paperwork will come from A6. 
- [ ] Complete & submit your initial paperwork per contract instructions, including setting up your fingerprinting appointment. 
- [ ] When you are notified to complete your e-QIP (the online version of the federal standard investigation form, SF 86), it will require a lot of background information. [Review page 7 of the SF 86 guide](https://www.dcsa.mil/Portals/91/Documents/pv/mbi/standard-form-sf-86-guide-for-applicants.pdf) in advance for the list of information you'll need to collect to complete e-QIP
### Why?
- [ ] Why is VA.gov using a Drupal CMS and how is our success measured? Read the [objectives and key results](https://va-gov.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/VAGOV/pages/96698383/Product+CMS).
- [ ] [Watch the Drupal GovCon presentation about the project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WN4bGjEuQdM).
- [ ] Why are VA Medical Centers changing their websites? Watch the [2-minute YouTube video](https://youtu.be/Xrv5wCv6cKY).
- [ ] Why are Vet Centers important to Veterans? Watch the [2-minute YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMzkZNbKk1I).
### How?
- [ ] Who is our team? [View this Mural diagram](https://app.mural.co/t/vagov6717/m/vagov6717/1653588059793/7a260edabca9535d25d71fac1035c979261c223c?sender=u252e7152800e3981889d1910)
- [ ] [How does the team work in an agile environment?](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/cms/onboarding/library/sprint-best-practices.md)
- [ ] How do Agile 6, CivicActions, Friends From The City, and Kind Systems work together on this project? Discuss with your Delivery Manager.
- [ ] How does the team fit into the larger OCTO ecosystem? [View this Mural diagram](https://app.mural.co/t/vagov6717/m/vagov6717/1643724063628/1654203c1a0d6c763bbd5c969febf94ec476df79?sender=kevinwalsh8610)
- [ ] How does OCTO fit into the VA universe? And how is VA structured? [View this Mural diagram](https://app.mural.co/t/vagov6717/m/vagov6717/1646447643431/1cbae3844c54a42877451e7a79706f0be048d740?sender=kevinwalsh8610)
  
### Who?
- [ ] Complete your personal information in the [official team roster](https://va-gov.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/VAGOV/pages/185270337/Team+Roster+2022). Note: this is separate from the Platform ecosystem's roster.
- [ ] Make your Google calendar publicly accessible, showing free/busy time. This will allow team members in other organizations to easily schedule with you. See [Mark your calendar as public](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37083?hl=en#zippy=%2Cmark-your-calendar-as-public).
- [ ] Let's start introducing you to the team and key stakeholders. If you're on a meeting where you don't know someone, feel free to kickstart an introduction. Everyone in the ecosystem is friendly and interested in connecting.
### When?
- [ ] Familiarize yourself with our team's [shared calendar](https://va-gov.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/VAGOV/calendars) and add in any known dates. This is where we coordinate upcoming out of office (OOO). Choose "Calendar" = OOO and "Event type" = whatever is relevant.

</details>

<details><summary>Week two</summary>

## Week two
The goal for this week is to get you set up with the tools you need to be successful. We will pair you up with a buddy on the project that is in your same discipline to help inform which ones are relevant and which aren't. **The most important thing is to get set up is SOCKS** as it will give you access to our systems so try to prioritize that.
### When?
- [ ] Check your calendar for invitations to team ceremonies.
  - [ ] Scrums
  - [ ] Planning sessions
  - [ ] Refinement sessions
  - [ ] Demos
  - [ ] Retros
### What products do we support?
- [ ] Discuss with your Delivery Manager, as this varies a lot by team. Review [this mural](https://app.mural.co/t/vagov6717/m/vagov6717/1658961045082/cedcb1c5c42489e47be37733c73890ef890070ae?sender=u252e7152800e3981889d1910) as a good starting point.
- [ ] [Review the editor onboarding slides](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/cms/onboarding/library/https___prod.cms.va.gov_sites_default_files_2021-07_Welcome%2520to%2520the%2520new%2520VA.gov%2520CMS.pdf).
- [ ] Read the [product sheets](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/raw/master/platform/cms/VA-CMS-Product-Sheets.pdf) (PDF download).

### Access 
Regardless of your role, please review these access notes. Your Delivery Manager will have set up most of the tools for you (with the exception of SOCKS). This list is for you to verify along the way:

#### Github for issue tracking and document sharing
  - [ ] [VA.gov request instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/github-user-requests/issues/new?labels=add-user-to-org%2C+new-user%2C+user-created&template=add-user-to-the-va-organization.md&title=ADD+USER+TO+ORG+-+%5BUSERNAME%5D) - Your Delivery Manager should have already requested this for you so double check with them before submitting a new request.   
  - [ ] [Zenhub extension instructions](https://www.zenhub.com/extension) - You'll need to install this on your preferred browser.
  - [ ] [Intro to CMS Team Github](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms#readme)
  - [ ] [CMS team list](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/teams/vfs-cms-team/members) - Same as above. You must be added to this team to contribute in Github.
    - [ ] New to Github and markdown? [Learn about writing on Github](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github) or [watch a tutorial video](https://youtu.be/TBbtbKplUoc)

#### Slack for instant messaging. 
Your Delivery Manager should have already requested this for you, but if not, view the [request instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/orientation/slack-requests.md)
  - [ ] [Review Slack etiquette](https://slack.com/blog/collaboration/etiquette-tips-in-slack).
  - [ ] Update your profiles in Slack (in the A6 and DSVA workspaces), add a calendar link
  - [ ] Your Delivery Manager should add you to appropriate Slack user groups for the DSVA workspace (e.g. `@sitewide-cms-team`, `@platform-cms-team`, `@cms-helpdesk`, `@public-websites-team`, `@facilities-team`. Also `@cms-engineers-group` for eng.)

You should be in the following slack channels:
 - [ ] A6/agency workspace = `#proj-vagov-team`
 - [ ] DSVA workspace = `#sitewide-program`, and your team channel e.g. `#cms-team`, `#cms-platform`, `#sitewide-public-websites`, `#sitewide-facilities`
 - [ ] [This is a description of other channels](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_lZzectbSzs8zt4dvTFJTiPURxa0Kfp3xinYEuZdqq4/edit#gid=0) that ought to be on your radar. Note that many are going to be dependent on which workstream you're in (DevOps, Helpdesk, UX, etc.). Feel free to join whichever you think will aid you and your work. 

#### SOCKS - VA network proxy
The VA network is required for Drupal CMS and other VA tools and usually requires a VA ID card (PIV or Smartcard). Until you get your paperwork approved and ID card, SOCKS proxy is a back door to some of these tools. This is the first priority for week two. 
   - [ ] File a [SOCKS proxy request](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/Internal-tools-access-via-SOCKS-proxy.1821081710.html) and select the label for your team. 
      - [ ] [Platform orientation](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/Calendly-Orientation-Sessions.2133393543.html#CalendlyOrientationSessions-GeneralOrientation). This should have been requested on day one as part of the Platform onboarding ticket but is here as a reminder that this is a blocker for SOCKS access as you'll need to get added to their ecosystem roster in order to proceed.
   - [ ] [Request a Github personal access token first](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token). You only need to do the "repo" panel in that form and leave the other panels as is. It may take a day or two for the SOCKS proxy request to be fulfilled before you can complete the rest of the SOCKS process. This can be a complex process. Post in #sitewide-program Slack channel if you need help from a current member - we're happy to help.
   - [ ] Optional [Core Tunnel set up for SOCKS proxy on all browsers on Mac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSuN9LhkB5o)

#### Drupal 
  - [ ] [Learn about the different Drupal environments](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/blob/main/READMES/environments.md)
  - [ ] If you are using a non-VA laptop for development you will need [follow the instructions on Github](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/blob/main/READMES/https.md) to trust the VA Root Certificate Authority (CA) in your browser(s)
  - [ ] Drupal production environment access (SOCKS or VA network required) - in DSVA #cms-support channel, use the Slack workflow to file a helpdesk support request. Ask the helpdesk to create a Drupal user for you in [prod.cms.va.gov](prod.cms.va.gov). 
     * DevOps team members require an administrator account. (SOCKS or VA access with PIV card required)
     * Standard practice for other roles is to have minimal access in prod (content editor or even a blocked account) and full admin access in lower environments.
  
##### Tugboat demo environments (Drupal)
Tugboat is a development server platform where you can preview CMS code changes pre-production. 
  - [ ] [Tugboat for engineers](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/blob/main/READMES/tugboat.md)
  - [ ] [Tugboat for non-engineers](https://prod.cms.va.gov/help/demo-environments-tugboat-guides) SOCKS required

#### Other tools / access

- [ ] [Confluence](https://va-gov.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/VAGOV/pages/179765342/2020-2021?NO_SSR=1) for team resources and calendar

- [ ] [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0ADx85_gnl3Y4Uk9PVA?ths=true) for team documents. Generally, VA doesn't use Google products. Use Github or downloadable files when sharing with VA.
