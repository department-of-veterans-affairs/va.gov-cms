# Welcome to the VFS-CMS / Sitewide Team! ðŸ‘‹
We're thrilled to have you join us on this journey! ðŸŽ†ðŸŽ‰ðŸ™Œ

This team consists of three product teams: CMS team (VFS-CMS contract), and the Facilities and Public Websites teams (Sitewide contract). Our teams are cross-functional and consist of Product, Delivery/Scrummaster, UX (Research, Design, Content strategy), Backend engineering (full-stack/Drupal), and Front-end engineering.

The VA's north star is to "continuously deliver high-quality digital experiences for the benefit of all Veterans and their families." From a CMS-perspective, our [vision](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14mK-4OMeEnR_-fgj62U4lUHBHg6htj4i4ucTA5DJFzg/edit#slide=id.g11ae1dc437e_0_1) is to craft a seamless editorial experience that empowers editors to create Veteran-centered content.

The onboarding materials below are organized by:
* chronological time to complete (day one, week one, week two, month one)
* and category

There's a lot to digest but don't worry, your Delivery Manager will guide you, you'll have an onboarding buddy to provide support, and we'll also introduce you to your workstream's lead to help with specific things related to your discipline (UX, DevOps, Drupal Engineering, etc). In addition, you'll have the support of the entire team, who have all gone through this process before and are eager to answer any questions that arise. Come back to this ticket any time to refresh your knowledge on a specific topic covered below. Have fun and we look forward to getting to know you! ðŸ˜Š

<details><summary>Day one</summary>

## Day one
Your top priority is any onboarding paperwork provided by Contract Onboarding folks. Start tasks below after that.

### Process & Principles
- [ ] Read through our [team norms](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cs5FePhtR0LIJi63b9ZtqT7T6dphgB584UpfEbejSOc/edit#), which will also give an overview of how we apply the [USDS playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov/) and VA.gov platform [code of conduct](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/policies-work-norms/code-of-conduct.md).
- [ ] Read the [VA.gov platform mission and goals](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/cms/onboarding/library/VA.gov%20Platform%20Overview%202021.pdf).
- [ ] Read the [VA's Office of the CTO (OCTO) engineering excellence guiding principles](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C04KXPXL4/p1674065912579799) [post in DSVA slack]

### People
- [ ] Meet with A6 Contract Onboarding Specialists (COS) to get an introduction to the paperwork process. They'll schedule.
- [ ] Who is our team? [View & bookmark this Mural org chart](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/vagov6717/1653588059793/7a260edabca9535d25d71fac1035c979261c223c?sender=u0b235d03cbd64f7f93673243)
- [ ] Complete your personal information & bookmark the [official team roster](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S31-cj0TPczh4K9r2G--kERqZStOOECX_W2VrQy3kRA/edit#gid=0). Note: this is separate from the Platform roster mentioned in Day 1 section.
    * Your DM will ask you to update your paperwork status until you receive official clearance.
    - [ ] Make your Google calendar publicly accessible, showing free/busy time. This will allow team members in other organizations to easily schedule with you. See [Mark your calendar as public](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37083?hl=en#zippy=%2Cmark-your-calendar-as-public).
- [ ] Who is on the team? Read your [team members' user manuals](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/195otsT1IUxi_k8oEU21TUkvEG-6p5YQj?ths)
- [ ] Create your own User Manual: duplicate [the template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rvtoo8CQvE7dptcqmMVqmJ_hbKSNWJ983NXkDj_gVg0/edit?usp=share_link), fill it out, and save your manual in your team's folder.
   - [ ] Share your user manual with your team in Slack, once you've created it!

### Access & Delivery
- [ ] Open a VA.gov [Platform orientation ticket](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/guidance-for-new-teams-and-team-members#Guidancefornewteamsandteammembers-NewVFSteammembers). Orientations may only be available several weeks out, so sign up as soon as you're able.
    * The VA.gov Platform team manages VA.gov tooling and network access. In order to receive access to many tools you'll need day to day, you must access the SOCKS network proxy (described later). For SOCKS access, you must 
        1. complete the steps described in the link above 
        2. complete your eQip paperwork and receive/provide a screenshot of the email with your E-QIP transmittal date,
        3. attend a Platform orientation. If a Platform orientation isn't available for several weeks, sign up for the next available slot, then mention your Delivery Manager and/or Program Manager on your Platform ticket to expedite SOCKS access.
    * When those steps are complete, the VA Platform team will add you to the [VFS Platform roster](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11dpCJjhs007uC6CWJI6djy3OAvjB8rHB65m0Yj8HXIw/edit?folder=0ALlyxurHpUilUk9PVA#gid=2042046665). This will allow you to get SOCKS access.
- [ ] Contract - Ask your Delivery Manager anything you would like to know about your contract.

<details><summary>Week one</summary>

## Week one
The goals of this week are: 
1) get background paperwork completed as quickly as possible 
2) start gaining context for what we're doing and why

### Access & Delivery
**Paperwork**
You'll receive an email from A6 COS directing you to the paperwork you should fill out for secure access to relevant VA systems. Federal contractors are required to complete many of the same forms as federal employees.
- [ ] Complete & submit your initial paperwork according to instructions, including setting up your fingerprinting appointment. 
- [ ] When you are notified to complete your e-QIP (the online version of the federal standard investigation form, SF 86), it will require a lot of background & family information. [Review page 7 of the SF 86 guide](https://www.dcsa.mil/Portals/91/Documents/pv/mbi/standard-form-sf-86-guide-for-applicants.pdf) in advance for the list of information you'll need to collect to complete e-QIP.

#### Github / Zenhub configuration
Github + Zenhub are the tools required for sprint boards, epics, estimates, and issue tracking for our team, as well as code version control. To work successfully: 
- [ ] New Hire: Create a Github user account
- [ ] New Hire: Add your agency email address to your Github account at https://github.com/settings/emails
- [ ] Delivery Manager: Creates a [Github request](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/github-user-requests/issues/new?labels=add-user-to-org%2C+new-user%2C+user-created&template=add-user-to-the-va-organization.md&title=ADD+USER+TO+ORG+-+%5BUSERNAME%5D) to add your Github user to the Dept of VA Github organization. This will provide you with access to view VA repositories. 
- [ ] New Hire: Accept the Github org invitation. It will appear as a yellow banner at the top of https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs
- [ ] Delivery Manager: After invite is accepted, add user to the [VFS-CMS team](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/teams/vfs-cms-team/members). You must be added to this team to contribute to [va.gov-cms repository](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/) code and issues in Github.
- [ ] New Hire: Install the [Zenhub browser extension](https://www.zenhub.com/extension) in your browser of choice
- [ ] Delivery Manager: Log into app.zenhub.com, click "Invite your team" button in lower left sidebar, invite new hire via their agency email address. This will generate a license request that must be approved by Zenhub admins within the VA. In the meantime, new hires may see a "You do not have a license" message when they log in to app.zenhub.com.
- [ ] VA Zenhub Admins: Must approve the license request. If they're slow about it, in DSVA slack, use @zenhub-admins to mention and request help. Licenses might not be approved until after the new hire has been fingerprinted. 
- [ ] New Hire: Verify Zenhub access by logging into app.zenhub.com, using Google auth with your agency email address. **Do not use Github oauth**. It's no longer supported by the VA.

**Sprint boards:**
You can view team sprint boards using either the Github view with Zenhub browser extension enabled, or the Zenhub webapp view.
* CMS team: [Github view](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/#workspaces/vagov-cms-team-5c0e7b864b5806bc2bfc2087/board), [Zenhub webapp view](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vagov-cms-team-5c0e7b864b5806bc2bfc2087/board)
* Facilities: [Github view](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/#workspaces/sitewide-facilities-639f5253e4b702a32376339e/board), [Zenhub webapp view](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/sitewide-facilities-639f5253e4b702a32376339e/board
)

<details><summary>Week two</summary>

## Week two
The goal for this week is to get you set up with the tools you need to be successful. We will pair you up with a buddy on the project that is in your same discipline to help inform which ones are relevant and which aren't. **The most important thing is to get set up is SOCKS** as it will give you access to our systems so try to prioritize that.

### Process & Principles
- [ ] Check your calendar for invitations to team ceremonies.
  - [ ] Scrums
  - [ ] Planning session
  - [ ] Refinement session(s)
  - [ ] Demo
  - [ ] Retro

### Context & History: What products do we support?
- [ ] Review [History of sitewide product portfolio & teams mural](https://app.mural.co/t/vagov6717/m/vagov6717/1646745279937/9a5570c420939d84e875e8334fd73073e3a3971b?fromVisitorModal=true&sender=u0b235d03cbd64f7f93673243).
    - [ ] Discuss with your Delivery Manager and Product Manager for more context on your team's products. 
- [ ] [Review the editor onboarding slides](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/cms/onboarding/library/https___prod.cms.va.gov_sites_default_files_2021-07_Welcome%2520to%2520the%2520new%2520VA.gov%2520CMS.pdf).
- [ ] Read the [product sheets](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/raw/master/platform/cms/VA-CMS-Product-Sheets.pdf) (PDF download).

### Access & Delivery
- [ ] [Opt out](https://www.va.gov/analytics-opt-out.html) of Google Analytics collection on VA.gov.
- [ ] [Opt out](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/?internal-user-opt-out=true) of analytics for Platform's website. You will not get a confirmation message and will have to do this for every browser and every time you clear cookies.

#### Github for issue tracking and document sharing
- [ ] [Intro to CMS Team Github](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms#readme) - describes an overview of our project in terms of repositories and architecture
    - [ ] New to Github and markdown? [Learn about writing on Github](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github) or [watch a tutorial video](https://youtu.be/TBbtbKplUoc)

#### Slack for instant messaging
- [ ] [Review Slack etiquette](https://slack.com/blog/collaboration/etiquette-tips-in-slack).
- [ ] Update your profiles in Slack (in DSVA and your agency workspace): add a calendar link, profile picture, your role and team.
    - [ ] Your Delivery Manager should add you to appropriate Slack user groups for the DSVA workspace (e.g. `@cms-team`, `@cms-helpdesk`, `@public-websites-team`, `@facilities-team`. Also `@cms-engineers-group` for eng.)

**Channels** 
- [ ] A6/agency workspace = `#proj-sitewide-vfs-cms-team`
 - [ ] DSVA workspace = `#sitewide-program`, and your team channel e.g. `#cms-team`, `#cms-platform`, `#sitewide-public-websites`, `#sitewide-facilities`
 - [ ] [VA Slack Channel Overview](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_lZzectbSzs8zt4dvTFJTiPURxa0Kfp3xinYEuZdqq4/edit#gid=0) describes useful channels to be aware of / join. Note that many are going to be dependent on which workstream you're in (DevOps, Helpdesk, UX, etc.). Feel free to join whichever you think will aid you and your work. 

#### SOCKS - VA network proxy (after your Platform Orientation)
The VA network is required in order to access Drupal CMS and other VA tools. Network access usually requires a VA ID card (also called a "PIV" or Smartcard). Until your paperwork is approved and you receive a PIV card, using the SOCKS proxy can provide earlier acces to some of these tools. **You cannot be approved for SOCKS access until your eQip is sent and you receive a "transmittal notice" confirming receipt.** If you have received an eQip transmittal notice, but not a PIV, please complete the steps for SOCKS access. This is the first priority for week two, especially for engineers. (If your role doesn't demand immediate access to the CMS, you may be able to wait until you receive a PIV.) 

This can be a complex process. Post in #sitewide-program Slack channel if you need help from a current member - we're happy to help.
  - [ ] Take a screenshot of your eQip transmittal notice.
  - [ ] [Request a Github personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token). You only need to do the "repo" panel in that form and leave the other panels as is. You'll need the output of this for your SOCKS request.
  - [ ] File a [SOCKS proxy request](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/Internal-tools-access-via-SOCKS-proxy.1821081710.html) and select the label for your team.  It may take a day or two for the SOCKS proxy request to be fulfilled before you can complete the rest of the SOCKS process. 
    - [ ] Attach your eQip transmittal notice screenshot. This is an acknowledgement that your paperwork is being processed from a security standpoint. You cannot receive SOCKS access prior to this point in your onboarding.
    - [ ] Add a comment to note the scheduled date of your [Platform orientation](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/Calendly-Orientation-Sessions.2133393543.html#CalendlyOrientationSessions-GeneralOrientation), if you haven't yet completed it. (This should have been requested on day one but is here as a reminder that this is a blocker for SOCKS access.)
- [ ] Optional [Core Tunnel set up for SOCKS proxy on all browsers on Mac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSuN9LhkB5o)

You can file the SOCKS request before completing your Platform Orientation, but it may not be approved/fulfilled until after.

#### Drupal 
Drupal is the VA's content management system of choice. For anyone on our team, it's beneficial to have a CMS user account so you can login, look at settings, and understand how the CMS works at a high level. If you need help completing the technical steps here, schedule 30 mins with your Delivery Manager.
  - [ ] **Drupal production access**: (SOCKS or VA network required) - in DSVA #cms-support channel, use the Slack workflow to file a helpdesk support request. Ask the helpdesk to create a Drupal user for you in [prod.cms.va.gov](prod.cms.va.gov). 
     * DevOps team members require an administrator account. (SOCKS or VA access with PIV card required)
     * Standard practice for other roles is to have minimal access in prod (content editor or even a blocked account) and full admin access in lower environments.
  - [ ] [View short presentations on specific topics](https://va-gov.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/VAGOV/pages/1714094110/CMS+Topic+Dives). Topics include site alerts, release and deploy, Facility API, etc.
  - [ ] [Browse the VA Drupal CMS Knowledge Base articles](https://prod.cms.va.gov/help/).
  - [ ] What is Drupal? [Link list for Drupal context and community](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11ppWiIggKJh-YAWia28utZXW48tJZGCEg-sFJ6eIl9c)

##### Tugboat demo environments (Drupal)
Tugboat is a development server platform where you can preview CMS code changes pre-production. 
  - [ ] [Tugboat for engineers](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/blob/main/READMES/tugboat.md)
  - [ ] [Tugboat for non-engineers](https://prod.cms.va.gov/help/demo-environments-tugboat-guides) SOCKS required

#### Other tools / access
- [ ] [Confluence](https://va-gov.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/VAGOV/pages/179765342/2020-2021?NO_SSR=1) for team calendar, demo run of show, and reporting.
- [ ] [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0ADx85_gnl3Y4Uk9PVA?ths=true) for team documents. VA doesn't have access to view Google products while on the VA network. Use Github or downloadable files when sharing with VA.
- [ ] [Trello](https://trello.com/vacmsteam) for retro boards
