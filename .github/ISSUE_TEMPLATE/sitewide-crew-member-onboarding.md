## Our mission
In contract language: 
> The Sitewide teamâ€™s mission is to increase VAâ€™s ability to deliver consistent, accessible, quality information across the VA.gov ecosystem. In accordance with the 21st Century Idea Act, the Sitewide team has a strong emphasis on integrating with or creating single-source- of-truth (SSOT) content structures. The Sitewide team subsequently uses these structures to build experiences on VA.gov in a predominantly unauthenticated user-space targeted toward Veterans, family members, and beneficiaries while other teams may, in a future state, access these same content structures via the Content Management System or other application programming interface (API)-based infrastructures in other experiences such as chatbot, mobile app, or other experiences to ensure accurate and consistent messaging. Sitewide builds and maintains these experiences using the VA.gov design system as well as user- centered design, mobile-first and accessibility-first practices.

The VA's north star is to "continuously deliver high-quality digital experiences for the benefit of all Veterans and their families." From a CMS-perspective, our [vision](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14mK-4OMeEnR_-fgj62U4lUHBHg6htj4i4ucTA5DJFzg/edit#slide=id.g11ae1dc437e_0_1) is to craft a seamless editorial experience that empowers editors to create Veteran-centered content.


## Our team
The Sitewide contract team consists of 2 product teams: Facilities and Public Websites. Our teams are cross-functional and consist of Product Manager, Delivery Manager, UX (Research, Design, Content strategy, Accessibility), Backend engineering (full-stack/Drupal), and Front-end engineering. We also closely collaborate with the CMS team and Platform teams who own the platforms we build on.

<details><summary>Day one</summary>

## Day one
Your top priority is any onboarding paperwork provided by Contract Onboarding folks. Start tasks below after that.

### Process & Principles
- [ ] Read through our [Sitewide team norms](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cs5FePhtR0LIJi63b9ZtqT7T6dphgB584UpfEbejSOc/edit#), which will also give an overview of how we apply the [USDS playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov/) and VA.gov platform [code of conduct](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/policies-work-norms/code-of-conduct.md).
- [ ] Watch the 1/31/2024 [State of OCTO recording](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:v:/r/sites/oitdigitaltransformation/Tech%20Tuesday%20Files/20240131%20-%202024%20State%20of%20OCTO.mp4?csf=1&web=1&e=4jqObK) and review the [related slides](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/oitdigitaltransformation/ERxPpNTQ6RxFlLpEjXbkg4ABaiBTOdXohIZ1OkksPwlnvw?e=ayadXo), to understand OCTO's vision and north star goals for this year.

<details><summary>Week one</summary>

## Week one
The goals of this week are:
1) get background paperwork completed as quickly as possible
2) start gaining context for what we're doing and why

### Access & Delivery
**Paperwork**
You'll receive an email from A6 COS directing you to the paperwork you should fill out for secure access to relevant VA systems. Federal contractors are required to complete many of the same forms as federal employees.
- [ ] Complete & submit your initial paperwork according to instructions, including setting up your fingerprinting appointment.
- [ ] When you are notified to complete your e-QIP (the online version of the federal standard investigation form, SF 86), it will require a lot of background & family information. [Review page 7 of the SF 86 guide](https://www.dcsa.mil/Portals/91/Documents/pv/mbi/standard-form-sf-86-guide-for-applicants.pdf) in advance for the list of information you'll need to collect to complete e-QIP.
- [ ] Our team uses [a shared Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0ADx85_gnl3Y4Uk9PVA?ths=true) for internal team documents or drafts. VA doesn't have access to view Google products while on the VA network. Use Github or downloadable files when sharing with VA.
- [ ] Trello for retro boards & daily scrum. (Workspaces are limited to 10 members on the free plan.)
  * Facilities: https://trello.com/w/sitewidefacilities
  * Public Websites: https://trello.com/w/publicwebsites3
  * Sitewide UX: https://trello.com/w/sitewideux

### Process & Principles
- [ ] Read about our teams' [Agile / sprint best practices](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/sitewide/sitewide-sprint-practices.md)
- [ ] How do Agile 6 and our partners work together on this project? Discuss with your Delivery Manager.
- [ ] Read your team's Charter:
    * [Facilities](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1eI1w9Bcj2rlmFtxkM6Dkn_c-Srszd88UxAQimSZkVqo/edit)
    * [Public Websites](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jiq90ffon5UxAqybiEncl8feqmXhEOChlijiDBOWUtc/edit)
- [ ] Check your calendar for invitations to team ceremonies.
  - [ ] Scrums
  - [ ] Planning session
  - [ ] Refinement session(s)
  - [ ] Demo
  - [ ] Retro

### People
- [ ] Familiarize yourself with our team's shared [Sitewide Team calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/1?cid=c2l0ZXdpZGUtdGVhbUBhZ2lsZTYuY29t) 
    * Ask your DM to give you write access to your team calendar, if you have not already been invited
    * If you have time off planned, add to calendar as OOO
- [ ] Let's start introducing you to the team and key stakeholders. If you're on a meeting where you don't know someone, feel free to kickstart an introduction. Everyone in the ecosystem is friendly and interested in connecting.

### Context & History
- [ ] How does the team fit into the larger OCTO ecosystem?

<details><summary>After Fingerprinting / SAC Adjudication</summary>

## After Fingerprinting / SAC Adjudication

After you've been fingerprinted and received government confirmation (SAC Adjudication), your Delivery manager will add you to VA Slack and VA Github. 

Note: Prior to eQip transmittal, the VA may grant network access. However: VA contractors should not access the VA network until the eQIP has been transmitted to the DCSA. Please refrain from accessing VA network (via CAG, Azure or otherwise) and do not request a temporary access password until you have submitted your eQip and received a transmittal notice. 

### Slack

- [ ] OCTO (DSVA) Slack: https://dsva.slack.com/. Update your profile, to include at minimum:
    - [ ] Profile photo
    - [ ] Title, Team, Agency (in Title)
    - [ ] Time zone
    - [ ] Contact information: agency email, and phone if you're willing
    - [ ] About me: VA email once you have one
    - [ ] Calendar URL - Get the sharable link for your Google Calendar from Settings/"Access permissions for events" and add it to your Slack Profile. This will allow team members in other organizations to easily schedule with you. 
    - [ ] Github alias
    - [ ] Working hours
- [ ] Your Delivery Manager should add you to appropriate Slack user groups for the DSVA workspace (e.g. `@public-websites-team`, `@facilities-team`. Also `@sitewide-engineers` for eng.)

**Channels**
- [ ] A6/agency workspace = `#proj-sitewide`
- [ ] DSVA workspace = `#sitewide-program`, and your team channel e.g. `#sitewide-public-websites`, `#sitewide-facilities`
- [ ] [VA Slack Channel Overview](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_lZzectbSzs8zt4dvTFJTiPURxa0Kfp3xinYEuZdqq4/edit#gid=0) describes useful channels to be aware of / join. Note that many are going to be dependent on your discipline. Feel free to join whichever you think will aid you and your work.

### Github / Zenhub configuration
Github + Zenhub are the tools required for sprint boards, epics, estimates, and issue tracking for our team, as well as code version control. To work successfully:
- [ ] New Hire: Create a Github user account
- [ ] New Hire: Add your agency email address to your Github account at https://github.com/settings/emails
- [ ] Delivery Manager: Creates a [Github request](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/github-user-requests/issues/new?labels=add-user-to-org%2C+new-user%2C+user-created&template=add-user-to-the-va-organization.md&title=ADD+USER+TO+ORG+-+%5BUSERNAME%5D) to add your Github user to the Dept of VA Github organization. This will provide you with access to view VA repositories.
- [ ] New Hire: Accept the Github org invitation. It will appear as a yellow banner at the top of https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs
- [ ] Delivery Manager: After invite is accepted, add user to the [VFS-CMS team](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/teams/vfs-cms-team/members). You must be added to this team to contribute to [va.gov-cms repository](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/) code and issues in Github.
- [ ] New Hire: Install the [Zenhub browser extension](https://www.zenhub.com/extension) in your browser of choice
- [ ] Delivery Manager: Log into app.zenhub.com, click "Invite your team" button in lower left sidebar, invite new hire via their agency email address. This will generate a license request that must be approved by Zenhub admins within the VA. In the meantime, new hires may see a "You do not have a license" message when they log in to app.zenhub.com.
- [ ] VA Zenhub Admins: Must approve the license request. If they're slow about it, in DSVA slack, use @zenhub-admins to mention and request help. Licenses might not be approved until after the new hire has been fingerprinted.
- [ ] New Hire: Verify Zenhub access by logging into app.zenhub.com, using Google auth with your agency email address. **Do not use Github oauth**. It's no longer supported by the VA.

**Github documentation**
- [ ] New to Github and markdown? [Learn about writing on Github](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github) or [watch a tutorial video](https://youtu.be/TBbtbKplUoc). Required for ongoing product documentation in https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products.
- [ ] [Intro to CMS Team Github](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms#readme) - describes an overview of the CMS product in terms of repositories and architecture. Drupal engineers will require this information but **UX** and **Product Managers** should strive to build a working familiarity with the CMS

**Sprint boards:**
You can view team sprint boards using either the Github view with Zenhub browser extension enabled, or the Zenhub webapp view.
* **Facilities**: [Github view](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/#workspaces/sitewide-facilities-639f5253e4b702a32376339e/board), [Zenhub webapp view](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/sitewide-facilities-639f5253e4b702a32376339e/board
)
* **Public Websites**: [Github view](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/#workspaces/public-websites-6171bf4bf43742001af18cc5/board), [Zenhub webapp view](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/public-websites-6171bf4bf43742001af18cc5/board)
* **Sitewide UX**: [Github view](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms#workspaces/sitewide-ux-660b03e631d26904d60775f5/board), [Zenhub webapp view](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/sitewide-ux-660b03e631d26904d60775f5/board)
* **CMS team**: also runs their sprints from the same repository, and any repo / workspace changes should be mindful of not impacting their [Github view](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/#workspaces/vagov-cms-team-5c0e7b864b5806bc2bfc2087/board), or [Zenhub webapp view](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vagov-cms-team-5c0e7b864b5806bc2bfc2087/board)

### General VA Access
- [ ] Open a VA.gov [Platform orientation ticket](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/guidance-for-new-teams-and-team-members#Guidancefornewteamsandteammembers-NewVFSteammembers). 
    * The VA.gov Platform team manages VA.gov tooling and network access. In order to receive access to many tools you'll need day to day, you must access the SOCKS network proxy (described later). For SOCKS access, you must
        1. complete the steps described in the link above
        2. complete your eQip paperwork and receive/provide a screenshot of the email with your E-QIP transmittal date,
        3. Complete a virtual Platform orientation. 
    * When those steps are complete, the VA Platform team will add you to the VFS Team Roster located in [Atlas](https://www.va.gov/atlas/). This will allow you to get SOCKS access.

</details>



<details><summary>Week two</summary>

## Week two
The goal for this week is to get you set up with the tools you need to be successful. We will pair you up with a buddy on the project that is in your same discipline to help inform which ones are relevant and which aren't. **The most important thing is to complete your eQip** in order to unlock SOCKS access, as it will give you access to our systems so try to prioritize that.

### Context & History: What products do we support?
- [ ] OUTDATED but useful for high level context: [CMS product sheets](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/raw/master/platform/cms/VA-CMS-Product-Sheets.pdf) (PDF download), describe various CMS-driven products. Points of contact and links may be broken. 

### Access & Delivery
- [ ] [Opt out](https://www.va.gov/analytics-opt-out.html) of Google Analytics collection on VA.gov.
    - [ ] More information: https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/analytics-monitoring/google-analytics-opt-out
- [ ] Opt out of analytics for Platform's website by clicking https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/?internal-user-opt-out=true. **You will not get a confirmation message** and will have to do this for every browser and every time you clear cookies. 
</details>


<details><summary>After eQip Transmittal notice received</summary>

## After eQip Transmittal notice received

### VA Network access
After you receive eQip Transmittal notice, you should receive an email confirming that you have been approved for remote access. 
 
If you need access prior to receiving your PIV card, You can contact Enterprise Service desk via provided instructions to set up your remote desktop access manually.

Once you have a temporary password, you can get on the VA network to access the links below. See [VA network remote access options](https://www.oit.va.gov/resources/remote-access/index.cfm?).

#### **If on Windows**: 
Windows users must use the Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD). 
* [Azure virtual desktop OIT link](https://www.oit.va.gov/resources/remote-access/azure-virtual-desktop/)
* [Instructions](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdigital.va.gov%2Femployee-resources%2Fremote-access%2Fazure-virtual-desktop%2F&data=05%7C01%7C%7Cdec2e51d4f3b472b1dec08db921d522a%7Ce95f1b23abaf45ee821db7ab251ab3bf%7C0%7C0%7C638264426849334591%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=2yQ9gfPbUzsJSICXG1TvFY8LJhsVKE%2FGB12%2Bs%2FPNrlY%3D&reserved=0). You'll need network access to reach that link, which you should receive instructions in email for how to achieve.

#### **If on Mac / Linux**: 
Mac users will also use Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) _eventually._ As of Aug 2023, if you are a new hire on Mac, you are a guinea pig. Do your best with these instructions, ask your DM for help if they don't work, and ask your DM to update this [issuetemplate](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/edit/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/cms-team-and-sitewide-crew-member-onboarding.md) with correct notes after it's all sorted out. Mac users have 2 options:

- [ ] 1. Azure web client: https://client.wvd.microsoft.com/arm/webclient/, IF you have a PIV card. There is an Azure desktop client but it wonâ€™t work on a mac because the mac application doesnâ€™t support PIV authentication. . (Try using Firefox and make sure pop-ups are allowed, at least for the MS domain if not globally (they are not allowed by default). Enter your VA email address. Connect your PIV card reader to your computer, and insert the card in the reader. Select â€˜Sign in using an X.509 certificateâ€™.
- [ ] 2. Citrix Access Gateway (CAG): use your Enterprise Service desk credentials or PIV card to log onto CAG and request an exemption [here](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.gov.powerapps.us%2Fplay%2Fe%2Fdefault-e95f1b23-abaf-45ee-821d-b7ab251ab3bf%2Fa%2F5823591d-4113-4f49-ba75-ea95a5081b41%3FtenantId%3De95f1b23-abaf-45ee-821d-b7ab251ab3bf%26source%3Dportal&data=05%7C01%7C%7Cdec2e51d4f3b472b1dec08db921d522a%7Ce95f1b23abaf45ee821db7ab251ab3bf%7C0%7C0%7C638264426849490249%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=36fW8GZiUuh1AhaokCn47xqF41PolOoaT40f%2BfGsDBs%3D&reserved=0)

### SOCKS - VA network proxy (after your Platform Orientation)
The VA network is required in order to access Drupal CMS and other VA tools. VA Network access typically requires a VA Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card with a chip reader. Until your paperwork is approved and you receive a PIV card, using the SOCKS proxy can provide earlier access to some of these tools. 

**You cannot be approved for SOCKS access until your eQip is sent and you receive a "transmittal notice" confirming receipt.**  If you have received an eQip transmittal notice, but not a PIV, please complete the steps for SOCKS access. This is the first priority for week two, especially for anyone who will require access to Drupal (UX, engineers, Product Management, etc.). If your role doesn't demand immediate access to the CMS, you may be able to wait until you receive a PIV.

This can be a complex process. Post in #sitewide-program Slack channel if you need help from a current member - we're happy to help.
  - [ ] Take a screenshot of your eQip transmittal notice.
  - [ ] [Request a Github personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token). You only need to do the "repo" panel in that form and leave the other panels as is. You'll need the output of this for your SOCKS request.
  - [ ] File a [SOCKS proxy request](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/Internal-tools-access-via-SOCKS-proxy.1821081710.html) and select the label for your team.  It may take a day or two for the SOCKS proxy request to be fulfilled before you can complete the rest of the SOCKS process.
    - [ ] Attach your eQip transmittal notice screenshot. This is an acknowledgement that your paperwork is being processed from a security standpoint. You cannot receive SOCKS access prior to this point in your onboarding.
    - [ ] Add a comment to note the status of your Platform orientation / link to your Platform orientation ticket. (This should have been requested on day one but is here as a reminder that this is a blocker for SOCKS access.)
- [ ] Optional [Core Tunnel set up for SOCKS proxy on all browsers on Mac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSuN9LhkB5o)

You can file the SOCKS request before completing your Platform Orientation, but it may not be approved/fulfilled until after orientation is completed.

### Drupal
Drupal is the VA's content management system (CMS) of choice. For anyone on our team, it's beneficial to have a CMS user account so you can login, look at settings, and understand how Drupal works at a high level. If you need help completing the technical steps here, schedule 30 mins with your Delivery Manager.
  - [ ] **Drupal production access**: (SOCKS or VA network required) - in DSVA #cms-support channel, use the Slack workflow to file a helpdesk support request. Ask the helpdesk to create a Drupal user for you in [prod.cms.va.gov](https://prod.cms.va.gov).
     * DevOps team members require an administrator account. (SOCKS or VA access with PIV card required)
     * Standard practice for other roles is to have minimal access in prod (content editor or even a blocked account) and full admin access in lower environments.
  - [ ] [View Topic Dives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/teams/sitewide/topic-dives) (short presentations on specific topics). Topics include site alerts, release and deploy, Facility API, etc.
  - [ ] [Browse the VA Drupal CMS Knowledge Base articles](https://prod.cms.va.gov/help/).
  - [ ] What is Drupal? [Link list for Drupal context and community](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11ppWiIggKJh-YAWia28utZXW48tJZGCEg-sFJ6eIl9c)
  - [ ] If you have a Drupal.org account, add your Agency & VA. Drupal.org > Login > My Account > Edit profile > Work tab > Add your agency, and "Department of Veterans Affairs" & save. This will help our team track Drupal open source contributions.

#### Tugboat demo environments
Tugboat is a development server platform where you can preview CMS code changes pre-production, along with staged changes from branches in other code repos (content-build & vets-website). SOCKS is required for Tugboat access.
  - [ ] [Tugboat for engineers](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/blob/main/READMES/tugboat.md)
  - [ ] [Tugboat for non-engineers](https://prod.cms.va.gov/help/demo-environments-tugboat-guides) SOCKS required

<details><summary>Month one</summary>

## Month one
By this point you should have enough context and access to be able to start contributing. Work with your team to identify specific issues to focus on.

### People
- [ ] Who are our VA points of contact? Discuss with your Delivery Manager or Product Manager.
- [ ] Who should we know on the platform teams? Discuss with your Delivery Manager or Product Manager.

<details><summary>After background check cleared</summary>

## After background check cleared
This is your last access hurdle! Congratulations. 

After your background check is complete, you will get an email to get your Personal Identify Verification (PIV) card. 

- [ ] Contact your local VA office (where you got your fingerprints taken) for information about getting your [PIV card](https://www.oit.va.gov/programs/piv/how-to.cfm?).
  - [ ] Review a [video about the benefits of the PIV card and VA network access](https://youtu.be/6rI-i8zmOzE).

  
  - [ ] PIV card will help you get remote VA network access.

Product Managers guide teams through this process, so it's beneficial to get familiar with their guidance documentation:

- [ ] [Platform Collab Cycle documentation](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/)
    - [ ] [Platform Collab Cycle calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=c_7iurst2mk3hdhfuto5u7lemgbk@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/New_York) -- bookmark this for use when scheduling Collab Cycle touchpoints
- [ ] [Research Overview](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-overview)
- [ ] [VA Design System](https://design.va.gov/)

**CMS Collab Cycle**
As of April 2024, the CMS Collab Cycle will be integrated into the Platform Collab Cycle. New documentation is TBD.

### Tracking features shipping
Product Managers are often involved in launch day activity and change management. Our environments are complex, and where the code was written will have a lot to do with when it deploys or how simple launch day will be. It's beneficial to build a basic familiarity with our environments, for that reason.
