# Welcome to the VFS-CMS Team! ðŸ‘‹
We're thrilled to have you join us on this journey! ðŸŽ†ðŸŽ‰ðŸ™Œ

Our vision is to build and maintain a best-in-class Content Management System that meets the needs of editors, application development teams, and consuming applications in order to empower our users to help Veterans.

The onboarding materials below are organized by 1) chronological time to complete (day one, week one, week two, month one); and main category (why, how, who, what). There's a lot to digest but don't worry, your delivery manager will guide you, you'll have an onboarding buddy to provide support, and we'll also introduce you to your workstream's lead to help with specific things related to your discipline (UX, DevOps, Drupal Engineering, etc). In addition, you'll have the support of the entire team, who have all gone through this process before and are eager to answer any questions that arise. Come back to this ticket any time to refresh your knowledge on a specific topic covered below.

Have fun and we look forward to getting to know you! ðŸ˜Š

<details><summary>Week one</summary>

## Week one
The goals of this week are: 1) get background paperwork completed as quickly as possible and 2) start gaining context for what we're doing and why
- [ ] Requesting secure access to the VA systems you need: **PTEMS** paperwork is through Liberty and **VFS-CMS** paperwork through A6. If you're not sure which you should fill out, ask your delivery manager. Federal contractors are required to complete many of the same forms as federal employees.
- [ ] e-QIP, the online version of the federal standard investigation form, SF 86, will require a lot of background information. [Review page 7 of the SF 86 guide](https://www.dcsa.mil/Portals/91/Documents/pv/mbi/standard-form-sf-86-guide-for-applicants.pdf) for the list of information you'll need to collect to complete e-QIP
### Why?
- [ ] Why is VA.gov using Drupal CMS and how is our success measured? Read the [objectives and key results](https://va-gov.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/VAGOV/pages/96698383/Product+CMS).

- [ ] Why are Vet Centers important to Veterans? Watch the [2-minute YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMzkZNbKk1I).
- [ ] Why are VA Medical Centers changing their websites? Watch the [2-minute YouTube video](https://youtu.be/Xrv5wCv6cKY).
### How?
- [ ] [How does the VFS-CMS team work in an agile environment?](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/cms/onboarding/library/sprint-best-practices.md)
- [ ] How do Agile 6, CivicActions, and Friends From The City work together on this project? Discuss with your delivery manager or product manager.
- [ ] How does the VFS-CMS team fit into the larger OCTO ecosystem? [View this Mural diagram](https://app.mural.co/t/vagov6717/m/vagov6717/1643724063628/1654203c1a0d6c763bbd5c969febf94ec476df79?sender=kevinwalsh8610)

### When?
- [ ] Familiarize yourself with our team's [shared calendar](https://va-gov.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/VAGOV/calendars) and add in any known dates. This is where we coordinate upcoming out of office (OOO). Choose "Calendar" = OOO and "Event type" = whatever is relevant.

</details>

<details><summary>Week two</summary>

## Week two
The goal for this week is to get you set up with the tools you need to be successful. We will pair you up with a buddy on the project that is in your same discipline to help inform which ones are relevant and which aren't. **The most important thing is to get set up is SOCKS** as it will give you access to our systems so try to prioritize that.
### When?
- [ ] Check your calendar for invitations to team ceremonies.
  - [ ] Scrums
  - [ ] Planning sessions
  - [ ] Refinement sessions
  - [ ] Demos
  - [ ] Retros
### What products do we support?
- [ ] [Review the editor onboarding slides](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/cms/onboarding/library/https___prod.cms.va.gov_sites_default_files_2021-07_Welcome%2520to%2520the%2520new%2520VA.gov%2520CMS.pdf).
- [ ] Read the [product sheets](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/raw/master/platform/cms/VA-CMS-Product-Sheets.pdf) (PDF download).

#### All team members need to review the following (note that with the exception of SOCKS, most of the tools will have been setup for you or requested by your delivery manager. This list is for you to verify along the way):
-  [ ] Github for issue tracking and document sharing
    - [ ] [VA.gov request instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/github-user-requests/issues/new?labels=add-user-to-org%2C+new-user%2C+user-created&template=add-user-to-the-va-organization.md&title=ADD+USER+TO+ORG+-+%5BUSERNAME%5D) - Your delivery manager should have already requested this for you so double check with them before submitting a new request.
    - [ ] [Intro to CMS Team Github](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms#readme)
    - [ ] [CMS team list](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/teams/vfs-cms-team/members) - Same as above.
    - [ ] New to Github and markdown? [Learn about writing on Github](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github) or [watch a tutorial video](https://youtu.be/TBbtbKplUoc)
    - [ ] [Zenhub extension instructions](https://www.zenhub.com/extension) - You'll need to install this on your preferred browser.
  
- [ ] [SOCKS proxy request](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/Internal-tools-access-via-SOCKS-proxy.1821081710.html) to access some VA network tools. The VA network is required for Drupal CMS and other VA tools and usually requires a VA ID card (PIV or Smartcard). Until you get your paperwork approved and ID card, SOCKS proxy is a back door to some of these tools. This is the first priority for week two. For the request, select the label for our team, currently "cms"
   - [ ] [Request a Github personal access token first](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token). You only need to do the "repo" panel in that form and leave the other panels as is. It may take a day or two for the SOCKS proxy request to be fulfilled before you can complete the rest of the SOCKS process. This can be a complex process. Post in CMS-Team Slack channel is you need help from a current member - we're happy to help.
   - [ ] Optional [Core Tunnel set up for SOCKS proxy on all browsers on Mac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSuN9LhkB5o)
   - [ ] When you have SOCKS proxy set up, contact the instructional designer for a Drupal and demo environments overview.
  
- [ ] [Learn about the different Drupal environments](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/blob/f4341c29ad8e998de1dac2fca0b749cdef15c923/READMES/environments.md)
  - [ ] If you are using a non-VA laptop for development you will need [follow the instructions on Github](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/blob/master/READMES/https.md) to trust the VA Root Certificate Authority (CA) in your browser(s)
  - [ ] Drupal production environment access (SOCKS or VA network required) - ask your delivery manager, product manager, or CMS Team helpdesk to set up an administrator account for you for [prod.cms.va.gov](prod.cms.va.gov)
  
-  [ ] Tugboat demo environments
    - [ ] [Tugboat for engineers](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/blob/f4341c29ad8e998de1dac2fca0b749cdef15c923/READMES/tugboat.md)
    - [ ] [Tugboat for non-engineers](https://prod.cms.va.gov/help/demo-environments-tugboat-guides) SOCKS required

 - [ ] [Slack](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/orientation/slack-requests.md) for instant messaging. Your delivery manager should have already requested this for you, but if not, view the request instructions in the link above.
    - [ ] [Review Slack etiquette](https://slack.com/blog/collaboration/etiquette-tips-in-slack).
    - [ ] Update your profiles in Slack (in the A6 and DSVA workspaces), add a calendar link
    - [ ] Your delivery manager should add you to appropriate Slack alias groups for the DSVA workspace
    - [ ] You should be in the following slack channels:
      - [ ] A6 workspace = `#proj-vagov-team`
      - [ ] DSVA workspace = `#cms-team`
      - [ ] [This is a description of other channels](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_lZzectbSzs8zt4dvTFJTiPURxa0Kfp3xinYEuZdqq4/edit#gid=0) that ought to be on your radar. Note that many are going to be dependent on which workstream you're in (DevOps, Helpdesk, UX, etc.). Feel free to join whichever you think will aid you and your work. Some channels have changed recently.
  

- [ ] [Confluence](https://va-gov.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/VAGOV/pages/179765342/2020-2021?NO_SSR=1) for team resources and calendar

- [ ] [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0ADx85_gnl3Y4Uk9PVA?ths=true) for team documents. Generally, VA doesn't use Google products. Use Github or downloadable files when sharing with VA.

- [ ] [Trello](https://trello.com/vacmsteam) for project management

- [ ] What do I need to know about my discipline on this team (DevOps, Engineering, Helpdesk, ID, UX)? Discuss with your discipline lead.
