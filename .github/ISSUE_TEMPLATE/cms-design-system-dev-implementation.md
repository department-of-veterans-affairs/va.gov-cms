## Description

- As a designer, I want to blank, so that blank.
- As a developer, I want to blank, so that blank.
- As a CMS Editor, I want to blank, so that blank.

## Atomic Level

These levels match the levels in [VA.gov Design System Documentation](https://design.va.gov/)

- [ ] **Foundation** - The Foundation section provides information about the visual language and styles used in the CMS.
- [ ] **Component** - Components are interactive and non-interactive UI elements that can be grouped together or presented individually. They are independent, reusable chunks of a user interface.
- [ ] **Pattern** - Patterns are solutions and researched best practices for solving user-focused tasks and recurring user interface design problems.
- [ ] **Template** - Templates, or page layouts, compose components within a single page. A layout can contain multiple variations of a component depending on the context.
