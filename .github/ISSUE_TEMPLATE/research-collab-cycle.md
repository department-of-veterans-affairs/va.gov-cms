## Description

### User story
**AS A** Researcher
**I WANT** to go through the relevant Collaboration Cycle before  conducting user research
**SO THAT** any design prototypes will be reviewed

- Veteran-facing research must go through Platform's [Collaboration Cycle](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/)
- Editor-facing research must go through the [CMS Collaboration Cycle](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/cms/collaboration-cycle)

Note: This step is a hard blocker for Veteran-facing research, but may be less so for Editor-facing research. 

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Created the necessary tickets for the Review Cycle
- [ ] Incorporated any feedback from the Review Cycle into the Research Plan and Conversation Guide
- [ ] Discussed any significant changes with the Sitewide UX Lead and maybe your Product Manager or Product Owner
