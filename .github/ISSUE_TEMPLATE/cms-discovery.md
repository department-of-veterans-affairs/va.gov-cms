## *About this form*

*Have you looked at the [Public Websites intake form](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=lunascoop&labels=vsa-public-websites%2C+vsa%2C+vsa-public-websites-intake%2C+needs-grooming%2C+Epic&template=public-websites-intake.md&title=%3CType+of+Request%3E+from+%3CTeam%3E)? If the "Why you're here" section fits your product's needs, please use that form instead!*

*If you don't have the answer yet to some of the questions, that's fine!*

*A CMS team member will be in touch to schedule a meeting to review, within a few days of receiving it, although the timing of that depends on our sprint capacity in the current and upcoming sprints. We allocate a set number of story points to each sprint to support VFS product teams.*

*Questions? Go to #cms-support in Slack.*

## Your product team

**What's your product called?**

**Provide a link to your [product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/product-management/product-outline-template.md)**

**Who’s who on your product team? Provide a link to your team’s page on the CMS, or a general sense of the product owner and those responsible for the product.**

**Who are the primary stakeholders for the product?**

**Which Slack channel on DSVA slack do you use to coordinate?**

## Content audit / inventory

**Describe the purpose of the content you want to manage from the CMS.**

**Does it already exist on another platform? If yes, provide links to the source platform (e.g. markdown file) and/or to the front end.**

**How many pages or pieces of content do you expect to manage from the CMS for your product?**

**Will any of the content need to be served as a part of authenticated experience?**

## Content ops & governance

**Who is responsible for writing and reviewing the content now?**

**Are there external reviewers of the content?**

**Who will own this content in the future?**

**What is your existing editorial workflow, if any?**

**Will some of the content continue to have a “source of truth” outside the CMS? If yes, what aspect of it (for example: a dataset living in another database)?**

## Training and access to CMS

**Who will need access to CMS to edit?**

**Will they need training?**

## Product roadmap

**What’s your timeline for going live OR for releasing the next iteration?**

**How do you expect the product to evolve, if at all, in the next:**

- **Weeks (you should know this)**
- **Months (you may know this)**
- **Years (you probably don’t know this, but if you had to guess…)**

## Next steps

**Propose some general time windows for the initial CMS discovery meeting.**
