  - In Editor-facing research, the Moderator should contact the participant through email or Microsoft Teams
- If the participant hasn't shown up within 15 minutes of the start, consider it a no show
  - Contact the participant to see if they can reschedule for a different avaialable slot 
  - If unable to reschedule, mark them officially as a no show in the recruitment tracker 
- Keep the PM and PO in the loop about no-shows in case additional sessions need to be scheduled
