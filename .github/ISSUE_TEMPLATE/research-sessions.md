## Description

### User story
**AS A** researcher
**I WANT** to conduct research sessions with participants
**SO THAT** we can get feedback on [PRODUCT/INITIATIVE]

**Guidelines**
- [Moderator guidelines](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/conducting-research-sessions)
  - [Research Safety guidelines](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-safety-and-emergency-exit-strategies) 
- [Notetaker guidelines](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/notetaker-guidelines)
  - For Veteran-facing research, Perigean can provide a notetaker
  - For Editor-facing research, recruit a member of the product team to take notes
- [Observer guidelines](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/observer-guidelines)

**Recruitment Trackers**
- Veteran-Facing research should follow [Platform guidance](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) on recruitment tracking
  - [VA recruitment checker spreadsheet in Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing)
- Editor-Facing research should track participants in the [VA.gov CMS UX research base](link TBD from CMS Platform team)

**No-shows and rescheduling**
- If a participant doesn't show up at the scheduled start time, they should be contacted
  - In Veteran-facing research, the Perigean will contact the participant by phone and email
  - In Editor-facing research, the Moderator should contact the participant through email or Microsoft Teams
- If the participant hasn't shown up within 15 minutes of the start, consider it a no-show
  - See if the participant can reschedule for a different available slot 
  - If unable to reschedule, mark them officially as a no-show in the recruitment tracker 
- Keep the PM and Sitewide UX Lead in the loop about no-shows in case additional sessions need to be scheduled
