## Background

### User Story or Problem Statement

<As a _____, I need _____ so I can _____.>

_or_

<Problem description. How might we _____________ ?>


### Affected users and stakeholders

* CMS_editors_of_X_product
* Developers of Y teams

<link to any existing research or data supporting this>

### Hypothesis

_A hypothesis may depend on a spike ticket to be completed._

We believe that _this_solution_ will achieve _this_outcome_. We'll know that to be true when _this measurable outcome occurs._

## Assumptions
* Tk
* Tk

(How will these assumptions be validated?)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Testable_Outcome_X
- [ ] Testable_Outcome_Y
- [ ] Testable_Outcome_Z
- [ ] Requires KB article update

## Design principles

Veteran-centered
- [ ] `Single source of truth`: Increase reliability and consistency of content on VA.gov by providing a single source of truth.
- [ ] `Accessible, plain language`: Provide guardrails and guidelines to ensure content quality.
- [ ] `Purposely structured content`: Ensure Content API can deliver content whose meaning matches its structure.
- [ ] `Content lifecycle governance`: Produce tools, processes and policies to maintain content quality throughout its lifecycle.

Editor-centered
- [ ] `Purpose-driven`: Create an opportunity to involve the editor community in VA’s mission and content strategy goals.
- [ ] `Efficient`: Remove distractions and create clear, straightforward paths to get the job done.
- [ ] `Approachable`: Offer friendly guidance over authoritative instruction.
- [ ] `Consistent`: Reduce user’s mental load by allowing them to fall back on pattern recognition to complete tasks.
- [ ] `Empowering`: Provide clear information to help editors make decisions about their work.


## Runbook
This is particularly relevant for feature launches, or for making changes to the content model that require front end changes as well.

## Possible tickets to create for this epic

- [ ] Spike task, with some of the following attributes:
* Identify the baseline against which we will measure improvements
* Ideation (sketching, cross-displinary meeting of minds around how the problem may be solved)
* Analysis of the drupal landscape
* Possible implementation(s)
* Proof of concept or prototype
* UX writing discovery

- [ ] User research
- [ ] Design
- [ ] UX writing
- [ ] Usability testing (eg with a prototype or other design stimula)
- [ ] Implementation
- [ ] Documentation (What needs changing or adding to the documentation?
- [ ] Product release notes (How will we describe this feature to CMS users?)
- [ ] Training (Will any users require additional training?)
- [ ] Metrics (How will we measure any improvements)
