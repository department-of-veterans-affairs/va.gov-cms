## Description

### User story

**AS A** researcher
**I WANT** to wrap up my research study
**SO THAT** I can share it with others and then move on

## Tasks

**Collaborate**

- [ ] Share draft research report with team and ask for feedback
- [ ] Incorporate feedback into report
- [ ] Discuss draft recommendations with team 

  - Recommendations are key outputs of the research process. They connect your findings back to the product roadmap(s) and shape the experience of future users. Depending on the type of research conducted, recommendations might be narrowly focused on improving a specific interface component of your team's product, or they might have broad implications for multiple parts of the VA.gov ecosystem. Work with your UX team, Product Manager, & Product Owner to generate, refine, and categorize recommendations. PMs and POs also play a key role in socializing recommendations to other teams.

- [ ] Work with Sitewide UX Lead, PM, and/or PO to discuss whether research readout(s) are needed. If so, determine audience and meeting length (default to a 30-min meeting with 20 min for presenting and 10 min for discussion).
- [ ] Work with PM to schedule research readout(s)
- [ ] *(optional)* Consider presenting research at Veteran Digital User Experience Weekly Design Sync meeting, slack Naomi Marcussen to schedule a date.

**Research Readout(s)**
- [ ] Draft readout presentation slides ([template here, which can be slimmed down](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13G80avWGdY7tHU40PbP_l05W1yRpDr-opOk0u_AAhzQ/edit#slide=id.g892adcb623_0_141)
- [ ] Share readout slides with Sitewide UX Lead for feedback
- [ ] Consider doing a practice runthrough to gauge flow and length
- [ ] Present readout(s) to team and/or stakeholders
- [ ] Revise report and/or readout slides per feedback from readout(s)
- [ ] *(optional)* If want to present research at Sprint Demo (recommended!), make a *very short* version of your readout slides


**Documenting Findings**
- Once your report is final, link to the relevant research repository
- Veteran-facing research:[How to add research to Platform Repo](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/70)
- Editor-facing research: [CMS Research Repository](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/cms/research)

**Destroying and Archiving Research Materials**
- Review your notes and synthesis materials to make sure they don't contain any PII. Then make sure they are added to your github Research Folder for archival purposes
- Once your readouts are complete, you should destroy any [session recordings](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recording-user-research-sessions) and transcripts saved to your local machine


## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Feedback incorporated into research report
- [ ] Recommendations drafted
- [ ] Readout(s) conducted
- [ ] Findings in Research Repo
- [ ] Session recordings and transcripts deleted from your local machine
