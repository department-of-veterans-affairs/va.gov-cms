## Steps (Rough)

Timing around these is critical and we may need more detail here.

On the original facility node:
- [ ] Change the old  API id on the old facility, to the new one.
- [ ] Change the section to the new one.
- [ ] save draft with good log message

On the new facility node:
- [ ] Change the API id to the to the old one.
- [ ] Change the section to the new old one.
- [ ] save draft with good log message


- [ ] Edit all the facility service nodes at that facility to point to the new systems service nodes. (save as draft, with good log)
- [ ] Publish all.
- [ ] Archive the new facility node.
- [ ] *May need to bulk op to update aliases.*
  - These probably need a redirect created, but not certain.

In the production DB:
- [ ] Update the migrate_map entry to swap the api ids. (replace old with new) (sql command in drush)

In [Lighthouse Facilties](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/lighthouse-facilities)
- [ ] CMS engineer updates the [CSV in Lighthouse](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/lighthouse-facilities/blob/master/facilities/src/main/resources/websites.csv) with the changed URL, creating a PR, tagging the Lighthouse team and linking to it in Slack with an @mention to a Lighthouse team member 

- [ ] HD notifies editor and any other stakeholders.
