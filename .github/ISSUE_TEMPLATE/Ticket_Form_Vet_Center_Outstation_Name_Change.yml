       ### Before creating a Vet Center Outstation name change ticket
       - Please do not create this ticket until the Vet Center Outstation name change has appeared on the CMS [Flagged Facilities page](https://prod.cms.va.gov/admin/content/facilities/flagged).

       - **If notified via Jira but not flagged in the CMS:** Confirm with the editor that they reported the Outstation name change to VAST. Please refer to the KB article "[How do I update my Vet Center facility's basic location data?](https://prod.cms.va.gov/help/vet-centers/how-do-i-update-my-vet-center-facilitys-basic-location-data)" for more info and send to editor if needed.

       - **If reported to VAST but not listed yet:** Changes made within VAST can take up to 75 days to appear within the Facilities API.

       - **If the help desk is waiting on info or actions from facility editor(s):** Please add the "Awaiting editor" flag to the facility node with a revision log message that includes Jira or Github ticket numbers. Do not change the moderation state of the node (e.g. "Draft", "Published") when adding or removing flags unless otherwise noted.

       - **For any Vet Center sections lacking active editors:** Please contact Barb Kuhn or the current VA leadership point of contact.

        URL redirects are not needed for Vet Center Outstation tickets because they do not have outward-facing URLs.

        However, you **must** update and re-save the URL alias for this Outstation node, or it will not appear correctly on the parent Vet Center's "Locations" page.

        ### Embedded Support team steps:

        #### STEP 1: Confirm name and section alignment
        Inspect the Outstation node’s H1 title, URL, and the **Main Vet Center** and **Section** fields.

        - [ ] **Yes, all match:** Proceed.
        - [ ] **No, due to active Vet Center name change:** STOP. Do not proceed until parent ticket is complete.
        - [ ] **No, Outstation appears reassigned to a new Vet Center:** Send the "Outstation section change verification" email below.

        **If the URL ends in `-0`:** Verify whether this node is a duplicate by removing `-0`. If duplicates exist, send the "Duplicate Outstation" email.

        ### Drupal Administrator steps:

        #### STEP 2: Update section fields
        - [ ] Update **Common name**, **Main Vet Center**, and **Section** fields on the Outstation node. Save.

        #### STEP 3: Bulk Edit updates
        Use the [Bulk Edit](https://prod.cms.va.gov/admin/content/bulk) page to:
        - [ ] Modify Values (section)
        - [ ] Update URL alias
        - [ ] Re-save content

        #### STEP 4: Update media
        - [ ] Verify associated Media items reflect the new name and section.

        #### STEP 5: Acceptance check
        - [ ] Confirm Outstation appears correctly on the new Vet Center’s "Locations" page after next release.

        ### Embedded Support wrap-up:

        #### STEP 6: Editor comms
        - [ ] Send the "Section change completed" email.

        #### STEP 7: Remove flags
        - [ ] Remove the `Changed name` flag and save the node.

        ### Outstation section change verification email
        ```
        The VA Drupal CMS Help Desk Support team received a notification that the former [OLD NAME OF OUTSTATION] has been renamed to the [NEW NAME OF OUTSTATION].

        The facility ID for this Outstation is vc_####OS.

        Here is a direct link to this node: [INSERT PRODUCTION LINK]

        Please confirm whether this Outstation was reassigned to a new Vet Center section.
        ```

        ### Section change completed email
        ```
        Thank you for confirming the Outstation reassignment.

        This Outstation is now assigned to your Vet Center section within the CMS:
        [INSERT PRODUCTION LINK]
        ```

        ### Duplicate Outstation email
        ```
        Hello,

        It appears there may be duplicate Outstation entries associated with your location:

        vc_####OS  
        vc_####OS  

        Can you please confirm which Outstation ID is currently in use?
        ```
