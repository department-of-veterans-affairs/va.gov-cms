## For Editor-facing research

**Recruitment / scheduling sessions** 
* The Research Lead should work with Product Manager, Product Owner, and Business Stakeholders to identify a list of potential participants
  * The pool of potential participants should be at least 2-3 times larger than the desired # of participants
* The Research Lead contacts and schedules participants 
  * Using their VA.gov email address or the shared VADrupalCMS@va.gov email address
  * Consider using Calendly or Microsoft Bookings to set up timeslots so participants can pick slots
  * The Research Lead should create placeholder calendar events to block those time slots and invite other team members
  * Ensure that teleconferencing rooms connected to the calendar events have correct permissions for Moderator(s)
* The Research Lead should create placeholder calendar events to block those time slots and invite other team members 
* Ideally one of the Observers should be a Drupal developer so that they might be there to help answer technical questions or see defects in action
* Once participants are scheduled, the Research Lead invites other team members to official calendar events
* The Research Lead should schedule 30-minute Daily Research Debrief meetings and invite Notetaker(s) & Observer(s)

**Pilots** 
[Guidance here](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-checklist#Researchchecklist-4-Run-a-pilot-session4.Runapilotsession)
* The Research Lead should schedule a pilot session (or two)

## Field Research and Unmoderated Studies
These types of studies have additional logistical considerations
* [Planning Unmoderated Studies](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/planning-unmoderated-studies)
* [Planning In-person Studies](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recruiting-participants#RecruitingParticipants-In-personmoderatedstudies)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The target number(s) of participants have been recruited and scheduled (for overall & primary criteria)
- [ ] The moderator(s), notetaker(s), and observer(s) have been invited to research sessions and daily debriefs
- [ ] Pilot session(s) have been conducted
