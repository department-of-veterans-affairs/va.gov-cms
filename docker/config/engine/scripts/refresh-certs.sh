# The logic here is not 100% solid. We are assuming if you dont have update-ca-certificates available
# then you PROBABLY dont need to wait for certs to actually be updated for any immedate build step
# because chances are your container doesnt have a build step or if it does it doesnt need certs to be in a good place.
# We do this because its substantially faster than waiting for ALL services to have certs good to go pre-start
