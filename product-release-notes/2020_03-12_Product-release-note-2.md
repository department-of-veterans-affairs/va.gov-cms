## ‚è≥ Fixed: Broken revisions tab for benefits hub landing pages

We fixed a bug that was breaking the revisions tab of 8 benefits hub landing pages, first noted when a link broke on /education. ([see this thread](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C52CL1PKQ/p1583888644111100))  

Our initial temporary fix caused some changes made by the public websites team to be dated to 1969. We've since solved time traveling related errors, and can report that many of the affected users had a groovy time at Woodstock.
