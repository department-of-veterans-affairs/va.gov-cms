# :arrows_clockwise: :interrobang: New: Standardized names for deployments

What the deploy? There’s lots of deployments, and we know it hasn’t always been easy to understand which ones will affect your work and when. We created standardized names for the deployments that affect content editors so everyone can start to communicate more clearly.

- VA.gov full code deployments = @ 2:00pm ET, updates front-end templates and causes a content release
- Content releases = @2:00pm ET, causes published content to go live
- CMS deployments = @3:30pm ET, won’t let you use the CMS while the code is being updated.

For the full details, check out this [VA.gov + CMS deployments artifact](https://whimsical.com/14gDq8UJ61yYx4cD4kHFKQ). We also created a [cliff notes version](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/blob/master/product-release-notes/screenshots/CMS-and-VAGOV-Deployments%20.png) for easy sharing.
