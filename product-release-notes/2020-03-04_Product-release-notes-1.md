### 🔄 New: Form for rebuilding content demo environments

![content demo environment](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/blob/master/product-release-notes/screenshots/1-rebuild-form.png "content demo environment")

We extended our testing infrastructure to be useful for other teams who want to demo their unpublished content. Teams can now use a self-service form to rebuild their own content demo environments. 

* Training required: contact VACMSSupport@va.gov to get training before using this form
* Check out [the latest documentation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/blob/master/READMES/environments.md#step-by-step-instructions-1) for step by step guidance

### 🔧 Fixed: Clone trouble

We fixed a problem that was preventing content editors from successfully cloning page content. Cloning living things is still difficult and controversial; cloning content in VA.gov CMS isn’t. 

* Content editors can now create duplicate content without error
* The CMS team is taking the opportunity to consider future improvements to the clone tab

### 🧚🏽 Improved: Streamlined editorial workflow options

We removed an outdated state from the editorial workflow called “staged.”

* Content can be saved as content as “draft,” “in review,” or “published.” That’s it.

### 🥢 Improved: Edit menu item titles at will

![screenshot: menu item titles](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/blob/master/product-release-notes/screenshots/1-menu-item-titles.jpg)

Previously the CMS wouldn’t allow you to change the menu link title in new drafts of already published content. Now you can edit and save those menu items during any stage of the editing workflow.
