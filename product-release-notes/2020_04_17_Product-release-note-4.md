# CMS Product Release Note #4
*04-17-2020*

## ðŸš§ New: notifications about system updates 

Friends don't let friends hit save during a deploy. Until now, content editors trying to save during CMS system updates (deployments) were sometimes at risk of losing their work. That can be frustrating, so we added some safety guards to keep that from happening. 

- You'll now see notifications before those updates happen, and you won't be able to use the CMS during the update. 

- As soon as it's safe to resume working, the CMS will let you know. 

- The updates will continue to happen every day around 3:30pm ET for up to 15 minutes while we make implement improvements to the CMS.

- Feedback and questions welcome in this thread. We got you.
