## For the CMS team

**Q: Should the thing I'm working on be mentioned in the CMS product release notes?**

**A:** Yes, if our work will cause changes our users will notice, such as when we: 
* 🐛 Fix a bug that’s in their way
* 🎁 Add a new feature to enhance their work
* 🦆 Something in between

**Q: Excellent. So how do I become release note famous?**

**A:** Flag it in the ticket
* 🟥 Use the maroon colored "release notes" label
