# :mega: CMS Release note #3: An alerts alert + some CMS improvements

We know content editors are working hard right now to get critical information on COVID-19 to Veterans and their families, so we’d like to share some information about using alerts that will help support your work.

The CMS team recently made changes to make alert blocks easier to use so you can get those urgent messages out. Here’s some information about alerts, plus what we’ve improved:

**3 kinds of alerts and when to use them**

:one: Full width **banner alerts**

- Appear at the top above all page content
- Use when it’s the very first thing every user needs to see
- Edited in /admin/content/alerts
- Can only be added to Drupal-powered pages for now (sorry - homepage banners, or other "nodeless" URLS have to be done elsewhere)

:two: In-page **alert blocks**

- Appear below the into text and above featured content
- Use for content that needs to “interrupt” the reader to call attention to a critical message.
- Edited in page content
- You can add as a reusable or custom alert


:three: In-page **alert content blocks**

- Appear below featured content
- Use to call attention to important information without as much of an interruption
- Edited in page content
- You can add as a reusable or custom alert

:shopping_trolley: Custom alerts can be tailored to a particular situation.

:recycle: Reusable alerts help keep more widely applicable, urgent information consistent and easy to disseminate.

:eyes: We know that picking the right alert is important, so we’ve made it easier to choose wisely by showing more information when editing and proofing benefits detail pages. You can now see:

- Alert content
- Type of alert
- Moderation state
- Owner
