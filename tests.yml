  # The following is necessary to ensure that the tests are set to "pending"
  # when the staging post-deploy tests start. If the tests are not all set to
  # pending, then there is a chance that the auto deploy Jenkins job will check
  # and only see the status of the tests that have completed so far, and so see
  # a "success" status, and then auto deploy. This is a problem because the
  # tests that have not yet completed may fail, and so the auto deploy will
  # deploy a broken site.
